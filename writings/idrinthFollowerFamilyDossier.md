# Idrinth's Family Notes

## Idileth the Crow

I am not quite sure what made him become such an enemy to me. He was asking simple questions, that I had simple answers for and somehow still prefered the Thalmor's rotten answers over the truth. I noticed him hunting me a few days ago, his smell is still very similar to my brother's.
It seems he has also followed me to Skyrim, something I did not expect. I need to do something about him before he becomes a real  problem, but on the other hand I don't want to harm family if I can help it.

## Calenith

Calenith should be one of my Great-Great-Great...Great-Nice, not quite sure how many "Great" it already has been. She has contacted me recently about a Bosmer lover of hers. I will write back a letter proposing for them to run to Skyrim, where the hold of the Aldmeri Dominion and the Thalmor is relatively weak and I can have a look out for them.
