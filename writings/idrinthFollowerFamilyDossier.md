# Idrinth's Family Notes

# Xelian the Crow

Xelian is a friendly one. He seems to have about much interest in crows as I have in wolves. It is very entertaining to exchange stories with him about our missadventures.
Sadly there is no chance to meet in person, as I am currently in Hammerfel and he is stationed at home, on Summerset.

## Alenia

Alenia is a special one, she seems to have the same interest in greatswords, that I have. I wonder if she'll find Trinimac as her major god as well. She'll certainly become a good warrior some day.

## Xinerna

I am quite sure Xinerna is one of the strangest, yet most brilliant minds I have encountered. I'm happy she is asking me for my opinions on Alteration magic, even if I'm sure she mastered it more than I ever could.
It has been a few hundred years since we started, but somehow I fail to explain to her how to turn into a wolf. It's frustrating to both of us, especially since it comes so natural to me.

## Idileth the Crow

I am not quite sure what made him become such an enemy to me. He was asking simple questions, that I had simple answers for and somehow still prefered the Thalmor's rotten answers over the truth. I noticed him hunting me a few days ago, his smell is still very similar to my brother's.
It seems he has also followed me to Skyrim, something I did not expect. I need to do something about him before he becomes a real problem, but on the other hand I don't want to harm family if I can help it.

## Calenith

Calenith should be one of my Great-Great-Great...Great-Niece, not quite sure how many "Great" it already has been. She has contacted me recently about a Bosmer lover of hers. I will write back a letter proposing for them to run to Skyrim, where the hold of the Aldmeri Dominion and the Thalmor is relatively weak and I can have a look out for them.
