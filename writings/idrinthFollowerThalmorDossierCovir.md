Status: Suspected Traitor

Description: male Bosmer, About 40 years of age

Background: This Bosmer is desired by Calineth Laemal, a relative of Idrinth Thalui. Besides the possible shame his relationship with Calineth would bring to her family, he is of interest to indirectly put pressure on Idrinth Thalui. His unusually strict adherence to the green pact may be a way to influence Calineth.

Operational Notes: Do not engage unless accompanied by Calineth. This Bosmer's life is forfeit once he has served in killing Idrinth Thalui.
