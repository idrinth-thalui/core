Status: Enemy

Description: male Altmer, at least in his 200s. Suspected Vampire

Background: This traitor to his own kind was first noticed by us during the Great War. He hunted for our supplies and engaged in battles few would have survived. A short time ago he started hunting our Agents in Skyrim since he has arrived. There is no close family to threaten him with, but some relatives may be useful. Their surveillance has been approved.

Operational Notes: Don't engage combat with him if you don't have backup, he has annihilated entire squads before. He is only wanted dead, don't keep him alive.
