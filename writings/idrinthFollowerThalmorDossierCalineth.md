# Calineth Laemal

Status: Suspected Traitor

Description: female Altmer, About 40 years of age

Background: This Altmer is suspected to be a possible candidate to put pressure on Idrinth Thalui due to their blood relation. Besides a distasteful liking to a Bosmer male, Covir Dornbranch, she has been unsuspicious. It is suspected, that she will flee to Skyrim with the mentioned Bosmer. If this relationship is engaged in, consider her a traitor to her own kind, only to be kept alive to catch a bigger fish.

Operational Notes: If met outside the Summerset Isles, engage her and possible companions to lure Idrinth Thalui into a trap. Her life after that point is insignificant.
