# Journal - Idrinth Thalui's Experiments
## Wolf Howling
### Day 1
I spend a long time this night listening to wolves and trying to imitate their howls. It is hard for my throat to form these sounds correctly.
### Day 4
I had the first little success tonight I believe, at least one wolf stared at me from a save distance after I practiced my howling.
### Day 5
The same wolf reappeared, this time coming closer. I will bring him some food tomorrow.
### Day 9
The wolf actually got himself the food, but stayed away from me. I guess I still seem to be too intimidating.
### Day 15
I think I may have found the answer, adding a bit of alteration magic to my throat to howl. Today the wolf answered, howling with me.
### Day 32
I think I'm getting the hang of it, calling my wolf friends works now almost at any time. My howl seems to be sufficiently close to theirs. That I add some meat as a reward for showing up certainly helps.
## Wolf Turning
### Day 1
Alteration seems like a perfect candidate for this, it allows me to hide my nature with  a mask already, so why shouldn't it allow for deeper changes?
### Day 2
So far no progress, I can not even seem to make fur appear. Will try mixing in blood into the spell, it should empower it.
### Day 7
Some progress, I ended up walking around with fur on my hands for almost a day. Had to hide from a lot of people due to werewolf suspicion.
### Day 19
While today was not as good as yesterday, I managed to reduce the magicka cost for adding fur a bit by instead of making it from nothing using the hair I already have as a baseline.
### Day 27
I managed to give me a snout like a wolf, took a couple hours until it faded back. I certainly made the Khajiit barmaid scream, when I showed my teeth with a smile. Didn't intend for that to happen, she's fine again now, calmed down quickly after I explained what I was doing.
### Day 41
I had to move to the wilderness to continue experimenting. Being half-wolf like for a few hours led to too many suspicions about a werewolf. I'm making progress at least.
### Day 58
Finally something more wolf like, I've managed to get the claws, fur and basic body shape, now I just need to improve the casting time, magicka cost and the exact outcome.
### Day 79
I think I turned into something close enough to a wolf today. It certainly didn't bother the actual wolves in my proximity, they reacted as they would have with any stray wolf.
### Day 94
I managed to get the spell under control for now, should come in handy if I have to flee from a strong enemy.
## The Thu'um
### Day 1
I have arrived in Skyrim, the land of the famous Thu'um. It is cold and close to an open war with it's own population. I have not heard a mention of the Thu'um yet, is it a forgotten art?
### Day 6
I've been told of the Graybeards, peaceful masters of the Thu'um. They don't quite match what I need, maybe I can get access to Ulfric Stormcloak?
### Day 17
Windhelm is by far to unfriendly to elves to stay there for long. I will need to first make a name for myself and then try to befriend the jarl to learn from him.
