# Letter from Calineth to Idrinth
Dear Idrinth,

I've been told by my mother, that you have been someone to ask for guidance for centuries already. That you are part of the family and therefore still help us, even if you are out travelling Tamriel at the moment.

I have an issue with my marriage plans, while my parents want me to marry an altmer, who is from a good family and has a great deal of power, my heart goes to my former bosmer best friend, who has neither a good enough family nor power or money.

I'm not sure what to do now, can I really dissappoint my parents that much? Can I live with myself if I don't follow my heart?

Please help me,

Yours,

Calineth
