## 5th Second Seed 4E5

... The refugees I've met told me the eruptions subsided.  From what I hear Ald'ruhn was completely destroyed, and my heart sinks. Did I fail my love again?
Will I be too late again to say my final goodbye? I have to brace the ashen storms soon. I have to find her grave. Was it not enough that we lost our life together
when I was turned into a bloodthirsty monster?  Arlinve, I cannot bear to lose your  grave as well...

## 23rd Mid Year 4E5

It was all in vain. What wasn't covered by lava is buried under ash, towering high above me. I cannot even find the burial chambers, let alone her... Oh, Arlinve,
ill-fated was the day we met, for I brought only sorrow to your life. May the Ancestors forgive me one day...

## 25th Mid Year 4E5

I found a few survivors. I can and will not linger here any more, for they have to be brought to safety. Farewell, my Arlinve. May we meet in the next kalpa.
