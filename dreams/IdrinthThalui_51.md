You watch a group of small, gold-skinned Elves stumbling drunk through the streets, catcalling women. A snow-skinned Elf in a white-gold armour steps in their way.
He leans on his two-handed sword and looks sternly at them. They bow their heads and hurry away, cursing under their breath.
You awake with a blush after hearing these foul curses.
