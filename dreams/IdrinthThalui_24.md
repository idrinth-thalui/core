Your eyes see a small crowd of Altmer standing before a priest. A very young Idrinth and a beautiful, young woman walk towards the priest, smiling happily at each other. The priest says a few words you can't quite make out, but you see the exchange of wedding bands. As you join the people congratulating, you feel like you don't belong, waking up just as you are about the see the face of Idrinth's veiled wife.
