You are lost in the darkness. You stumble around, searching for something, anything to find. Your hands find a rough stone wall. Groping your way,
you find yourself in a big circular room with no door to be felt, and the ground made of large, cut boulders. Then you feel something behind you...
something big. Very big. You awake with a start.
