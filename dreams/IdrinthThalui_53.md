You walk through the tall-spired Elven city. before you a bronze-skinned Elf and two leashed, round-eared women with silvery skin are stopped by a priest of Auri-El.
"Your human slaves will not defile this holy ground, Ayleid heretic!" The Ayleid storms away, dragging the frightened women behind him. The crowd gives way for them,
their backs turned, faces distorted in disgust. You awake angry.
