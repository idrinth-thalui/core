You stumble through the ruins of an Altmer village. A terrible battle has taken place. You hear a scream and run towards it. Altmer twin boys huddle together
under an upturned cart, and a grown Altmer in hooded black robes towers above them. You can hear his feral snarl, as he leaps at the shrieking children...
You awake, hands searching unconciously for your weapon.
