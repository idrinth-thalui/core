You walk trough the night. Up ahead a group of Khajiit huddle around a campfire, weapons drawn, ears flat against their heads, fangs bared. You notice no other sounds
than their breath. Then a vicious snarl erupts, and a tall figure lands between the Khajiit, lashing out with his blades. Within moments all of them lay on the ground,
and the tall figure bends over to drink their blood. You wake up with racing heart.
