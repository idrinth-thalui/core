You walk trough the night. Up ahead a group of Khajiit huddle around a campfire, weapons drawn, ears flat against their heads, fangs bared. You notice no other sounds
than their breath. Then a vicious snarl erupts, and a tall figure lands between the Khajiit, lashing out with a greatsword. Within moments all of them lay on the ground,
and the tall figure bends over to drink their blood. You wake up with racing heart.
