You walk trough the night. Up ahead a group of Khajiit huddle around a campfire, weapons drawm, ears flat against their heads, fangs bared. You notice no other sounds than their breath.
Then a vicious snarl erupts, and a tall figure lands between the Khajiit, lashing out with a greatsword. Within moments all of them lay on the ground, and the tall figure bends over
and starts to drink their blood. You wake up with racing heart.
