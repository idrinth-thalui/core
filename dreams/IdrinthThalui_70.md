You are at a wedding ceremony - YOUR wedding ceremony. Your love opens a small jewellery box to reveal two earrings shaped like a mermaid holding a pearl.
You smile as you remember the day you found the pearls. "May they protect us from any harm, my love." she whispers as she puts the earrings on both your right ears.
You awake with your fingers touching your ear.
