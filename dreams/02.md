You see a shadow hovering over your sleeping body. It bows dow, showing fangs before biting your neck. When it stands back up straigth after having drank from your blood, you recognise Idrinth in his greyish elven armor quickly retreating from your bed. As you awake, you are unsure if you really dreamed it or not.
