You walk trough the night. Up ahead you see a campfire, a group of Khajiit traders huddled around it. Their voices sound joyous, but the two armed guards scan the area
with eyes and ears. Then silence falls around you. The Khajiit stand up, all ready for a fight, their backs to the fire. After a few moments the nocturnal animals resume
their nightly concert, and the Khajiit relax. You wake up.
