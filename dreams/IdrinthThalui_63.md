You lean against the wall, bored and tired. You start to make faces at the solemn party guests, till a priest of Auri-El steps towards you.
Snarling in disgust, he scolds you for not acting befitting of your noble upbringing. You square your shoulders and attend a more graceful position,
but make a face at the priest's back. You awake with a smile.
