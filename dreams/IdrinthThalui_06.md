You awake from pressure on your chest, like someone pressing down on you. Staring into your eyes are a pair of other eyes with a cold, hungry expression. You try to scream, but your mouth is covered by a hand. Laughing quietly and showing fangs, the vampire bows down to bite your neck, revealing Idrinth's face a moment before the teeth touch your neck. You awake screaming.
