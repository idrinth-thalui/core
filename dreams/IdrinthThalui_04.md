During the night you wake up from the sound of quiet movement in your room. You see a tall silhouette sneaking towards the window, with a hand on their greatsword. As you grab for the weapon by your side, a small bit of light unveils Idrinth's face on the silhouette, staring ad the window and listening for something. Feeling well taken care of you slide back into bed and sleep until the next morning.
