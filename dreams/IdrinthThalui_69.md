You climb down the cliffs to a hidden lagoon. Your love dives first into the crystalclear waters. She comes up again with a big oyster in her hands.
It opens at her touch and reveals two beautiful pearls inside. She picks them up gently and releases the oyster again. "The stars are with us." she whispers.
You wake up with the scent of the sea still lingering.
