You awake to the smell of roses and pumpkins. The New Life Festival! You hurry down to join your siblings in getting your portion of Aldmeri orphan gruel, before your whole family sets out to bring food and presents to the poor people, many of them Chimer. You sing along happily with your siblings. You awake homesick.
