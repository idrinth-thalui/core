You walk home with your family from your aunt's New Life Festival party. A bunch of small children with antlers jump out of the orchard and throw mudballs at you.
They miss you and hit your father. The kids freeze in shock. Your father frowns at his muddied robe, then burst out with laughter.
You awake with a chuckle.

Limit to: Altmer, Bosmer, Dunmer, Orsimer
