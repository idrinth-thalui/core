You find yourself in a cage, starving with hunger. Around you vampires are eating, feasting on blood... Your nostrils twitch at the scent, your fangs bare themselves,
eager to bite... You shake your head, clench your fists and curl up in a ball. Your stomach growls loudly, and you hum a sad tune to drown the sound.
You awake hungry.
