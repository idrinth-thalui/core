You sneak away from the Spring Ball and the girl your parents wanted you to dance with. In the starlight you see a shadow waiting for you beneath the cherry trees.
A few petals had fallen in her hair, and you brush them away. She embraces you, and you two start to dance to a tune only you can hear.
You awake with a tear in your eye.
