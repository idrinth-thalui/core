You play on the beach. A bronze-skinned noblewoman strides past, two children with her. The girl looks like her, and orders the pale-skinned boy around to gather sea shells. He stumbles near you, and as you reach out your hand to help him, you see his round ears. He flinches and stands up hastily, apologising all the time. His eyes are wide with fear. You awake confused.
