Before you open your eyes, you hear someone crying. As you open them, you see slaughtered people, in their midst someone kneeling, crying and looking at his blood soaked hands. It takes you a moment to recognise a younger Idrinth as the person kneeling. As he raises his head and sees you, your eyes meet with his dead but sad gaze. He whispers "I'm sorry" as you awake.
