You are at the harbour, watching a storm-damaged ship. It looks different from all ships you've ever seen, and the Elves have blueish skin, shining like mother-of-pearl.
They look darkly at the crowd. Altmer guards are standing ready, letting no spectators through. Your mother grabs your hand and pulls you away.
You awake with the nagging feeling of danger.

Limit to: Altmer, Bosmer, Dunmer, Orsimer
