During your sleep you get disrupted by the sound of someone climbing into your window. Not long after the figure of someone wearing elven armor appears and softly jumps into your room. You are sure you know who it is by the beard, so you fall asleep again, planning to ask about it in the morning. When morning arrives you awake, thinking you had a weird dream.
