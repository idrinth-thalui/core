You watch a fight between an Altmer vampire and an Ice Giant. The vampire seems to lose intentionally. The giant gropes for the vampire's right ear,
and with a roar the vampire viciously slashes the giant to pieces with his two blades. Then he adjusts his earring as if nothing happened.
You awake with a start.
