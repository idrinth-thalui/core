Your eyes open. You see a dirty roof above you and hear mumbling and crying from close by. Trying to lift yourself up, you see that the room is full of Khajiit. The coughing starts getting noticeable now, as one of the Aldmeri healers moves towards you. "Lie down my friend, you need to keep your strengt to fight of the plague!" he says while gently putting you back into bed. Before you awake, you recognise the pain in Idrinth's eyes as he looks upon you.
