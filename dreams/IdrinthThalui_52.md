You play with your siblings on the beach. Another boy comes towards you, about your age yet smaller than you. You start building a beautiful sand castle,
imagining to be both mighty gryphon riders. Your mother calls you away, warning you not to play with Chimer again. As you look back, the Chimer boy cries silently.
You awake filled with sadness.
