- *sigh* Feeling a bit hungry
- Do not worry about me, I can hold on for weeks.
- *sniff* Ah, that smell...Forgive me, I was distracted.
- Now a nice bandit attack...
- I was sure I had one left...
- Huh? Sorry, was I staring at your neck?
- Oh, I apologize. That was my stomach.
- Ah, a nice, fresh, warm drink...
- Do we have some wine left?
- We should get some supplies soon.
- Sure you don't have any spare blood potions?
- Truth be told, I'm getting hungry.
- Ah, the taste of blood...forgive me.
- I do have to insist we start repairing these pipes soon.
- Trinimac grant me strength...
- Must...not...stare...at neck...
- *sigh* How long are we here? Must have been ages...
- I need to drink...
- Ah, so thirsty!
- Ancestors help me find my fixed centre.
- Ah, sweet blood...
- *snarl* You smell delicious...
- *growl* Must. Remain. Strong...
