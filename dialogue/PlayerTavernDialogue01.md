- Idrinth: "While we're sitting down comfortably, would you mind to answer a few questions of mine?"

- 4.1: "Ah, my heart grieves for what became of Morrowind. The ash still weights heavy on the land."
- 5.1: "I long to see the White-Gold Tower again. I wonder if any remnants of the ancient Ayleid buildings survived the war..."
- 6.1: "A proud land, full of proud warriors. Alas, since the war my kind is not welcome there."
- 7.1: "The land of castles and cabals. I have to admit, I stand out in court like a dancing bear."
- 8.1: "A strange land, indeed. Though I am intrigued by the Hist and their relationship with Argonians."
- 9.1: "A cold land with a tragic history. As a lad I wanted to visit my Snow Elven cousins, but never made it happen..."
- 10.1: "You have travelled a long way. Maybe sometime you will tell me more about your home?"
- 11.1: " I sense you are not like us. I hope you will see your home one day again."

- 1p: "The War still haunts me. So I try to forget..."

- Idrinth (answering to the profession): 
- 1a.1: "I have heard of both great deeds and great horrors. I grieve that my people were at fault. Lorkhan take the Thalmor!"
- 1b.1: "Ah, a life full of surprises. May your gods let them be happy ones."
- 1c.1: "I venture that trading became both more dangerous and more lucrative. May you never run out of customers."
- 1d.1: "The search for knowledge is a noble one. May Syrabane prevent you from becoming drunk by the power that comes with it."

- 1k.1: "I will not pry on your secrets. May you find the confidence in me to tell me another day. Until then, Trinimac guard us both."
- 1l.1: "I understand. Auri-El light our path, and Trinimac guide our blades. But if you are coming for me..."
- 1m.1: "May your path be guarded by your patron deity."
- 1n.1: "Always good to seek out other masters than your first one. Refine your craftsmanship."
- 1o.1: "I pray that this dream was sent by a benevolent entity. The Daedric Princes love to mess with mortals in this way, too."
- 1p.1: "I grieve with you. I heard many a tale from the Great War, and to think my own people started this madness...May you find peace someday."

- Idrinth: "I thank you, that was all I wanted to know for now. Perhaps we can refrain our little chitchat one day?"
