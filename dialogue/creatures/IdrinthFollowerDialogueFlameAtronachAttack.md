- You dare throwing fireballs at me, daedric scum?
- Your fire won't stop me from sending you back to Oblivion!
- Trinimac, lend me your strenght!
- Burn in Oblivion!
- By the Paragon, begone you walking campfire!
- Just looking like a female won't stop me killing you!
- Know your place, fire harlot!
- Do I look like a callow conjurer? Your looks don't entice me!
