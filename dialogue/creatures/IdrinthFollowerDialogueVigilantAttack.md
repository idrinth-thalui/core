- I'm on your side!
- I do not wish to fight you!
- Why do you hunt the vampire hunter?
- Do not make me fight you!
- Trinimac, why me?
- Go hunt some daedra!
- Do not make me harm you!
- You people again?
- For the last time, I am on your side!
- Why can't you leave me alone?
- Go hunt some real dangers!
- Trinimac, make them see reason!
- Stendarr, call them back!
- Spread your justice elsewhere!
- Ancestors, not you again!
- Do I look like a daedra?
- Stendarr have mercy on you!
