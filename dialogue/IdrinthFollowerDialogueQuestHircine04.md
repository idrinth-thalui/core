Noble of you offering to help him. He seemed genuine in his desperation, and Hircine is known to twist his hunts for his amusement. I only fear for you while wearing the ring.
Ancestors know what Hircine will do to you ere you finally talk to him. We should head out into the woods immediately. Your beast blood may boil any moment under the ring's spell.
Do not fear, I will stay by your side to make sure you will not hurt anyone.
