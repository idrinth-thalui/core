- It is good to walk with a fellow Altmer.
- We should sit down and talk about the Isles in the next inn.
- Do you miss the sunset on the Isles, too?
- Which city do you hail from? Alinor? Shimmerene? Cloudrest?
- I loved walking through the orchards while the cherries and peaches bloom.
- Have you ever see the gryphon riders circling around Eton Nir?
- HAve you ever tasted a Golden Pear Punch?
- I do hope you don't find Skyrim too cold for your taste.
- The Isles have changed much under Thalmor rule, I fear?
- I long to return to the Isles. But with the Thalmor, I may never will.
- I hope noone you love was taken to the camps.
- Ah, I wish you could have seen the Crystal Tower during sunrise. It was sheer beauty.
