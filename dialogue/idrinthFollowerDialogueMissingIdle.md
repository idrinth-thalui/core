- I remember the day Avulstein and Idolaf were hunting a skeever. I had to save them from it, and heal their wounds. They were like brothers as kids.
- Thorald and Avulstein were often the first to see me when I get into Whiterun. Always playing "Hunt the Elf" with me...
- It happened more than once that I tended to their bruises and helped them clean up ere going home.
- I hope Fralia never finds out about that bear cub... Eorlund made me promise not to tell her. Ever.
- They were wild at play, like any child, but they are good boys. And kind-hearted.
- I hope Thorald will one day able to sleep without nightmares hounting him constantly.
- I am glad Avulstein does not know how dangerous the Thalmor really are - he'd be sick with worry.
