# Ondolemar.
- He is good at what he does, sadly. He makes it hard to counter his moves, since he has no obvious weaknesses. All his accomplishments are believable for him, he is just that good. Sadly he is completely rotten to the core, following the Thalmor's objectives without question.
 - Oh, if only he had been born in they days of Queen Ayrenn... he would have been one of the greatest Thalmians, worthy to be in the Thalmor's Inner Circle of Advisors to the Queen herself. 
 - A man destined to be a Paladin of Justice, now distorted to a Lord of Evil by the Thalmor. My heart grieves for the loss of such a great soul.
