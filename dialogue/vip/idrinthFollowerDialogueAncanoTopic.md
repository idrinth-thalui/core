# Ancano.
- He was great when he was young. An untamed mind, searching for answers. Sadly with age he has gotten involved with the Thalmor. I fear there may be nothing left of his good side.
- I wonder what happened to him to become so bitter...and how such a great mind ended up here in Winterhold. No offence, but the College... it is way beyond Ancano's aptitude with the flows of magic.
