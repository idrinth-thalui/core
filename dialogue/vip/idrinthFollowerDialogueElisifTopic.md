# Elisif the Fair.

- She doesn't strike me as a great leader, but then again she is supported by General Tullius. From what I have heard, she doesn't have any achievements worth mentioning. I'm surprised the Empire didn't decide to back a Jarl with more strength and support.
- Guess the Empire uses a pretty face and impressionable mind as a figurehead.
- I can understand her grief. The loss of your spouse... it hurts. No matter how long ago it was.
