# Runil

Runil was one of the opponents I feared during the great war. He was one of the best battle mages I have seen in that war. That he fled the Thalmor and found his calling in Arkay gives me hope for the future. He may not be able to repay the damage he caused in a single lifetime, but neither can I. He is a brave man to live with such knowledge and pain.
