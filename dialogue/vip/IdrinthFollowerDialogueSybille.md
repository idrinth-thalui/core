# Sybille Stentor.

- She is a powerful mage. One who has the court at her fingertips.
- She is a powerful daughter of the night. She backs that up with powerful magics. No wonder that the court is frightened of her.
- She seems to like Elisif. But how noble is her motivation?
- I heard a rumor that she sometimes visits the prison. A vile end for any criminal.
