# Wuunferth the Unliving.

He is a powerful mage. I'm not sure if he actually uses necromancy, but if he does he is a huge security issue. If he does not, he must be very careful to stay in good standing with his jarl. I'm not sure how he came to his title, he is neither a Draugr, Lich nor a Vampire.
