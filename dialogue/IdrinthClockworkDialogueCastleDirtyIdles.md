- Cobwebs everywhere... with my luck we have a nest of frostbite spiders lurking in one room.
- The dust is piling up everywhere.
- Another part of the tapestries getting loose.
- When was the last time someone swept the floor?
- Guess Lahar just stood there in darkness for some time.
- *cough* So much dust!
- Spider webs. Again. I hate spider webs.
- Those paintings would look beutiful without the coat of dust on them.
- With the lights on it looks even more desolate.
- Peeling wallpaper everywhere... this place is slowly falling apart.
- Great. Peeling wallpaper covered in cobwebs.
