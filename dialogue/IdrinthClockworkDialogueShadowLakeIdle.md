- Great, she is still following.
- Make sure to search every corner, stars only knows what is needed to stop her.
- At least she gives enough light.
- This constant floating under the ice makes me uneasy.
- Why do cursed apparitions never right up tell you what they want?
- I hope she won't break through the ice.
- This eerie light is sending shivers down my spine.
- Trinimac grant me strength. She won't leave us alone.
- If that thrice damned Isidor didn't attack us, HE would be the one being followed. Shame that didn't happen.
- I fear it will only get worse with her.
- My sweet Arlinve...
- May my ancestors not welcome me soon.
- Jephre's knees, I'd prefer this to be a vampire lair. At least I won't get hungry too soon.
- An underground Dwemer city and a cursed Chimer maiden following us under the ice - good times indeed.
- Lorkhan take that wretched soul!
- This is the most awkward light any Altmer in history ever had to light his way.
- Our friend still following? Ah, yes, she is.
