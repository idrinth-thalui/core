# What did you do during the Great War?
- I spend more time waiting for fights than actually fighting.
- I tried to survive, being an Altmer is not easy when they are the enemy.
- I hunted the hunters of the Blades.
- I tried to help the Empire where possible.
- I was fighting the Thalmor, helping resistance movements in conquered territories.
