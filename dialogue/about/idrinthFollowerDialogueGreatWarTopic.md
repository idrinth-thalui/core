# What did you do during the Great War?

- I spend more time waiting for fights than actually fighting.
- I tried to survive, being an Altmer is not easy when they are the enemy.
- I hunted the hunters of the Blades.
- I tried to help the Empire where possible.
- I was fighting the Thalmor, helping resistance movements in conquered territories.
- Some of my actions caused a bit of a stir, after all I look similar to Aldmeri soldiers.
- I started getting hunted then and there. My main hunter had not yet given up when I entered Skyrim.
- That would be a long story. To keep it simple I waited a lot, fought a little and survived.
