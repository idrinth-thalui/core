# What weapons are your favourites?
- Not fangs, I can tell you that. Try getting Khajit fur out of them!
- Any kind of melee weapon, I like to spill the blood of my enemies.
- I follow Trinimac, so take a wild guess!
- Greatswords are my main weapon - especially elven ones.
- I like greatswords, but I can deal with about anything.
