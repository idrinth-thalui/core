# Why are you in Skyrim?
- This civil war is our best chance for a better future, if the Thalmor don't gain from it.
- It changed, now I want to taste a dragon.
- To see the dwemer's cities again - it has been a long time.
- To stop the vampire stupidity from harming all of us.
- To stop the Thalmor from destroying everything.
