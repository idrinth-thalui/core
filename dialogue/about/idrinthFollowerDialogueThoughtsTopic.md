# What are you thinking about?

- The gods, isn't it weird how inactive some of them are?
- Magic, I specialised in restoration, but I'm thinking about learning more.
- Combat, I wonder if I should use more or less magic.
- Werewolves. I wonder how my life would have been if I was one.
- The Dragonborns. I've seen a lot of other powerful beings, but none like them.
- Vampires, how come most are an evil to be rooted out?
- The Aldmeri Dominion, it still surprises me how easily it was rebuilt.
- The Great War, I hope some wounds will heal before the second one.
- My father, he was strict, but well meaning - something we could use right now.
- My Birthplace, somehow those butterflies reminded me of my mother's garden.
- The Thalmor, I know we are racist all in all, but they are extremists even for us.
- Dragons, why are they even trying to conquer and kill?
- Reviving the Blades. Stopping the Thalmor is something they could manage.
- I love the blood of bandits in the morning!
- It's smaller than I thought, but it's still impressive. I've never been here before.
- Dwemer, I'm wondering if they are somewhere in Oblivion.
- Giants, it's sad to see these majestic creatures treated like troublemakers.
- I guess no one dares to attack them, the walls look unmaintained.
- This new capital looks decent, they are hiding their skeletons well.
- This city was once kingly as the name suggests. It really doesn't deserve the title now.
- It's nice to fight side by side with another Altmer again.
- The Falmer, it's sad how this once proud species lost their minds and souls.
- Long ago Falmer were like us Altmer, a proud and noble people. The true kings of the North.
- The Dwemer and Falmer, it is strange how quickly the Falmer turned into beasts after being helped by the Dwemer.
