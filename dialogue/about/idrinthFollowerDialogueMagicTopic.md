# What do you think about magic?
- Some Nords consider magic unnatural, for all I have experienced, it is part of all of us.
- I wouldn't trust those dealing with brainless undead or daedra, otherwise it's a great help.
- I prefer restoration and alteration, but the other schools have their value as well.
- Besides necromancy and conjuration, I think the risks are manageable.
- I think magic is a powerful tool, like any other it can be abused tho.
