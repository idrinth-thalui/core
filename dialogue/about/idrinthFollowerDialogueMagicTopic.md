# What do you think about magic?

- Some Nords consider magic unnatural. For all I have experienced, it is part of all of us.
- I wouldn't trust those dealing with brainless undead or daedra, otherwise it's a great help.
- I prefer restoration and alteration, but the other schools have their value as well.
- Besides necromancy and conjuration, I think the risks are manageable.
- I think magic is a powerful tool, like any other it can be abused tho.
- Since the Oblivion Crisis Nords deeply shun all kinds of magic, yet their ancient God of Magic, Jhunal, is revered now as Julianos.
- In the old days of Atmoran rulers, magic was called "the Clever Craft". Too many wars with mer made the Nords wary of it.
