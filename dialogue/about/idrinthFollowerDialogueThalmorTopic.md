# Can you tell me more about the Thalmor?
- They are an interesting and powerful faction. Based on our weaknesses, they force our people into wars that drive us to extinction. Additionally, based on our strengths, they try to destroy all opposition.
- Think of them as the evil in the hearts of the Altmer. They conquer and kill and see no reason to let any none mer live. Also they lack individuality, they drive it out of everyone.
- The Thalmor have been my enemies for as long as I can remember. They desire a return to the past, while I desire a better future for all of us. Worst of all, they will likely kill everyone for their goals.
- The Thalmor are everything evil in us Altmer turned to the extreme. They won't rest until they conquer and control all. And that is the best case, worst case they will kill all none mer.
- I think of them as an illness, that has infected the Altmer. Insecurity since the Oblivion Crisis and a lack of strong leadership empower them. We all reacted too late to stop them relatively easily and quickc. Now they are settled in and will be hard to remove.
