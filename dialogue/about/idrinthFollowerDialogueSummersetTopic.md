# Can you tell me about the Summerset Isles?
- The mainland is by far the biggest of the Isles. It houses many big cities and towns in its rolling hills. The Crystal Tower on it is especially impressive.
- Auridon is the second largest island in the Summerset Isles. It is home to the cities of Firsthold, Skywatch, and Vulkhel Guard.
- Artaeum, one of the isles, is the only one I have never visited. It is home to the Psijic Order, a very powerful organization.
