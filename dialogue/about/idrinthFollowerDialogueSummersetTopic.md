# Can you tell me about the Summerset Isles?
- The mainland is by far the biggest of the Isles. It houses many big cities and towns in it's rolling hills. The Crystal Tower on it was especially impressive. I wish you could have seen it before it collapsed in the Oblivion Crisis. I think losing Crystal-Like-Law is what lead to the Thalmor's dominance. We Altmer felt like we lost a part of our souls that day. And turned to whatever strenght we could find.
- Auridon is the second largest island in the Summerset Isles. It is home to the cities of Firsthold, Skywatch, and Vulkhel Guard.
- Artaeum, one of the isles, is the only I never visited. It is home to the Psijic Order, a very powerful organisation.
- My parents took me to visit the Crystal Tower once, when I was a child.... it was filled with light, bright as the sun. And when we were on the top, paying our respects to our ancestors, I could see as far as Valenwood....
