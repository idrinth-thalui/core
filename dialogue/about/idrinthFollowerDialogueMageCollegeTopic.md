# What do you think about the College of Winterhold?
- The Eye of Magnus is an interesting artefact. Too bad it has been taken away by the Psijic Order. I can't say I trust them enough to keep it and us safe.
- The Staff of Magnus is an interesting artefact. I never thought the College would ever get something this exiting!
- The Augur seems to be an interesting creature. I'll spend some time here in the future to try and study him. He's way more interesting than most mages of flesh and bone, wouldn't you agree?
- Did you read about the "Night of Tears" you got from Fellglow Keep? It's history worth remembering, not worth repeating.
- I'm curious about the secret found under Sarthal. I'm sure there is more to be found given a few centuries worth of study. This object tho, it seems familiar, even if I can't place it right now.
- I liked their focus on defence in the first lesson. It is wise to keep yourself alive first and foremost. Personally I prefer armor enhancements over wards tho.
- I doubt their expertise a bit. They seem to lack a sizeable amount of mages that study. On the other hand they are still a useful institution to teach magic to newcomers.
