# Do you want to be healed of your vampirism?

- I have been a vampire for longer than most people live. I'm so used to it's limitations and benefits, it would be strange to exchange them. Additionally we are in a time that needs every bit of power to quickly end the civil war. Only a united and strong Skyrim can keep the Thalmor at bay. I don't have the luxury of leaving the fight before I have to.
- I'm quite happy being who I am. Yes, there have been thoughts about retiring, but there is still too much to experience. Even someone of my age, didn't often have the chance to meet dragons. So I have to decline for now.
-That is a hard question to answer. I have thought a lot about it, when I was just a young vampire. It seemed to me, that at that point, there was just not enough to do. Right now though, we have strong Thalmor, strong Daedra and Dragons to hunt. It's just not the right time to think about a kind of retirement.
