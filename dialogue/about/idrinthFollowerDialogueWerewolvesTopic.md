# What do you think about Werewolves?

- Very fluffy usually, I like running with them in wolf form.
- Formidable fighters, there is a reason my sword is silvered.
- If you keep your hunger at bay, you are a strong bunch.
- Some are beasts, but most are reasonable and good hunters.
- Well, you are not the first one I've met.
