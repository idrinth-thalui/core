Alas, how far the Thalmor had strayed from their former selves. Under Queen Ayrenn they were the backbone of the Aldmeri Dominion, keeping us Altmer, Bosmer and Khajiit together.
In the olden days, the Thalmor protected the Isles and the ideals of the Aldmeri Dominion. And they stayed true to these goals. But now...
The Oblivion Crisis brought out the worst of the Thalmor. What you see is a mockery, nay a distortion of their ancient counterparts.
It grieves me to see so many bright young Altmer being turned and twisted by the vile new ways of the Thalmor. If only they had lived in the days of yore...
Once, many Bosmer and Khajiit were amongst the highest ranks of the Thalmor. Hard to imagine in these dark times. Now they are mere servants, if not less..
The Thalmor claim they uphold the superiority of themselves over all others. Even other Altmer. In the elden days, the Divine Prosecutors would have them imprisoned for heresy.
