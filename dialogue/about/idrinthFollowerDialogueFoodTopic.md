# What food do you prefer?
- Saying no to a good soup is hard.
- Many things, even garlic from time to time.
- As you can guess, I mostly live off blood.
- I prefer talking about drinks, how about red wine?
- I prefer fresh meat, in the best case hunted.
- There are few kinds of food I haven't tried, but simple meals are fine by me.
- Give me a hearty Nord stew over a posh Breton 9-course-meal anytime.
- I'm quite fond of Morrowind cuisine.
