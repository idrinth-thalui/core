# What food do you prefer?
- Saying no to a good soup is hard.
- Many things, even garlic from time to time.
- As you can guess, I mostly live off blood.
- I prefer talking about drinks, how about red wine?
- I prefer fresh meat, in the best case hunted.
- There are few foods I haven't tried, but simple foods are fine for me.
