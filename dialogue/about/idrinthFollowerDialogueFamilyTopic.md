# What about your family?
- I don't have the best relationship with my blood family. We disapprove of each other's god.
- My blood mother, a Nord, had a thing for mer. A lot of my brothers and sisters are mer.
- My blood family has spread through all of Tamriel, it's not unlikely we will meet one of those Molag Bal worshippers.
- My family doesn't share my last name, since that is more of a title given to me.
- There is no family in Skyrim right now as far as I know.
- My former wife and I split after a few years, but stayed in contact.
- My sister may be long dead, but she had children. Some of her descendants are still alive and well. They sometimes send letters asking for advice and talking about their lives.
- I lost my wife to time, she died of old age, never accepting the blood kiss.
- My former wife was once the center of my life.
- My father died because he worked too hard, never took enough of a break.
- My mother is dead, she lived a long, fulfilling life.
- I never had children, just never had the chance to get any.
