# How did you become a vampire?
- I was infected by a disease and died from it, before being reborn stronger and faster.
- It was actually on my first trip to Tamriel from the Summerset Isles.
- I didn't go looking for it,that's certain.
- A daughter of Coldharbour took a liking to me and decided to change me.
- I was turned when I was still young, barely an adult yet.
