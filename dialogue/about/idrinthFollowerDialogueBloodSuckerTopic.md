# How did you become a vampire?

- I was infected by a disease and died from it, before being reborn stronger and faster.
- It was actually on my first trip to Tamriel from the Summerset Isles.
- I didn't go looking for it, that's certain.
- A Daughter of Coldharbour took a liking to me and decided to turn me.
- I was turned when I was still young, barely an adult yet.
- I was turned in a court not dissimilar to the one of Lord Harkon.
- While I was turned against my will, the change at first overwhelmed me and I lived as a monster. It took long years to recover from both the monster as well as the cage I was in.
