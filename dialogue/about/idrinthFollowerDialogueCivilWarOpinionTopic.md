# What's your opinion on the current civil war?

- I'm happy we managed to free those prisoners from the fort.
- Good thing, that we got the faked courier's orders into enemy hands.
- A good thing we captured the enemy's weapon shipment, isn't it?
- I'm glad you decided for a side, let's bring them victory!
- The Imperials have a point in trying to stay united and strong.
- The Stormcloaks have a point in wanting to pray to Talos and having a strong leader.
- The Thalmor are the only ones benefiting from this continuing war.
