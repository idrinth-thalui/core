# Who are you?

- I'm a lover of wine, women and winning - what did you expect?
- I'm an old warrior, but not yet tired of fighting daedra.
- I'm a hunter of the night, not quite like you.
- I'm a vampire like you, who has enjoyed long travels through Tamriel.
- I'm just an Altmer who has travelled Tamriel for a long time.
- I'm just an ordinary citizen reacting to the world around me.
- I'm an ancient evil, barely kept in check by my faith in Trinimac.
