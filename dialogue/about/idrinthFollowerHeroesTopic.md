# Who is your paragon among the heroes of Tamriel?
- A recent addition to my paragons is General Tullius. His tactical genius is something to aspire to.
- An addition from the Great War was the Emperor Titus Mede II. He showed a willingness to self-sacrifice for the betterment of others. The Battle of the Red Ring showed this clearly.
