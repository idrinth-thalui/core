- This place goes on and on. I almost forgot how the stars look like.
- I could swear we've been here before.
- How deep down are we?
- I'm amazed Skyrim hasn't caved in so far - there are more Dwemer tunnels beneath than are Nords above.
- Normal automatons are one thing - these Gilded are really disturbing.
- I just hope the Thalmor will never find out how the Gilded were built - they would love it.
- Is it just me or is it getting hotter?
- Their geometry is interesting.
- With our luck there'll be daedra lurking in the lava.
- It could be quite restful here - if it weren't for the Gilded.
