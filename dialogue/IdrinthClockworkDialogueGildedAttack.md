I'll hack the armour from your bones!
Just brass and bones!
I'll weld you into a cube!
Trinimac, I'll beat some sense into you!
You want to bite me? Me!?
Gilded? You're just skeletons wearing armour!
Why don't you have any blood left!
Gaaah! I dented my sword, you graxifalas!
Stop repeating yourself!
You're dumber than a coral crab!
You accursed bloodless mechanical madmen!
I hate this Dwemer ruin!
