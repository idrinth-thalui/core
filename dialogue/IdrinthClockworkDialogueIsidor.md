I: Why did that man attack us? He doesn't look like the usual bandit, and highwaymen normally don't work alone. Must have been rather desperate.


##  2nd reaction (Letter found)

I: Xarxes' backside, did nobody tell him that people wearing exquisite gear are mostly more than capable of using it? Trinimac, getting some good stuff

   After a quick refreshment, if you don't mind.
