- This was it. No more travels with you.
- You were well taught by the Thalmor doctrine. A shame for our ancestors.
- A typical Nord, I expected more... But I'm just an Elf, right?
- Embarrassing for a Dunmer, you are no House Redoran material.

- Acting like a true Thalmor servant, Khajiit.
- I presumed the Orsimer would have more honour. I was wrong.
- Bretons are truly silver-tongued. Playing all sides, "diplomat"?
- Who ever thought Redguards were noble warriors? They were wrong.
- Fork-tongued Argonian. I knew you were coldblooded.
- Imperials. As long as you win, morals don't matter.
- You were destined for greatness, Dragonborn, yet you failed.
- I gave you a second chance. There will be no third.
