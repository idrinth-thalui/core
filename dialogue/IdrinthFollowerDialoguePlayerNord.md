- Do you feel the blood of your Atmoran ancestors in your veins?
- You were born to roam these cold lands.
- A pity neither of us will see the Snow Elven cities of old.
- If you prefer milk over mead - I won't judge.
- Be honest: How long did you think I was a Thalmor? You still do?
- Do you think your fellow Nords will turn back to their ancient Nordic deities?
- I do hope none of your ancestors were among the draugr from the last crypt.
- What do you think about the dragons?
- Do tell me your favourite song is not Ragnar the Red.
- I do hope the next inn has cheese scones.
- Which kind of mead do you prefer?
- I do hope me being an elf makes your ancestors squirm.
