There it is - the shrine of Meridia. I presume that this is the wrong moment to tell you that her daedric followers are the very same Aurorans who were summoned by
Umaril the Unfeathered? And her realm are teh Coloured Rooms which she created after Molag Bal occupied her original realm and turned it into Coldharbour. Apologies,
I just try to delay the approach. She hates vampires and will surely not tolerate me. The only thing we have in common is our hatred for Molag Bal.
