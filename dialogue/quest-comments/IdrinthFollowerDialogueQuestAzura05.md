And here is the one responsible for all this tragedy. What were you trying to do, Malyn? Become a lich? Entrap yourself in a soul gem forever? Was it all worth it?
This poor girl had her whole life ahead of her, and you stole it for your vile schemes. How many had died to sustain your soul? And all this because you tried to
cross a Daedric Prince. It's time you'll face your righteous punishment.
