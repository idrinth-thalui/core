Well, now I'm torn. Malyn must clearly be stopped, but Azura's method was not the best, either. Though it would be wise to secure Daedric Artifacts, if it will
trap black souls as a result - no, that price will be too high. But the choice is yours. Off to Ilinalta's Deep, ere more souls are lost forever.
