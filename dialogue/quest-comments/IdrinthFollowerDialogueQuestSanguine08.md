- Morvunskar. I remember cleaning it out once. Not the place I would choose for a wedding. I wonder if Sam Guevenne picked the place. maybe he's one of the mages here... wait.
  Sam...Guevenne. Could it be... Sanguine? Stars above, were we tricked by the Daedric Prince of Debauchery? Auri-El preserve us!
- Morvunskar. Cleared out a group of rogue warlocks there once. A cruel jest to name this as the place of a wedding. We should find out if my fears are true. Stars, I hope not.
