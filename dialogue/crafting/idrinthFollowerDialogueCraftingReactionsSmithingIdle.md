- Are you sure you want to hold the hammer this way?
- You should start with something easier first...
- Let me take a few steps back...
- Don't hit yourself!
- Hm, at least that one is in one piece.
- You got a long way ahead, but you got better.
- It's something...
- At least you know how to smith iron.
- You sure you're up to smith elven metals?
- Oh, a wonderful iron dagger. Again.
- You do love iron daggers, don't you?
- Nice weapon.
- Nice armour.
- YOu're getting pretty good at this.
- Admirable.
- You are good enough to be a good apprentice.
- There are not many smiths left to teach you.
- Keep up, and you'll surpass Eorlund.
- Now that is craftsmanship!
- Ah, beautiful to behold.
- You could become Eorlund's successor.
