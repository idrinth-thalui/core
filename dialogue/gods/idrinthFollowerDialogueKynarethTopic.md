# Kynareth.
- For me she still is Kyne, the Sister-Hawk. She is a very powerful goddess and controls the skies. She's a representation of the world's nature and it's powers, and her wrath is the raging storm.
- Kynareth is the name she was given as one of the Eight Divines. And she was turned from the fierce warrior-wife of (Lorkha... er, ) Shor to a kind mother watering the crops.
