# Namira.

- I'm not a fan of cannibalism. She just doesn't bring anything positive as far as I can tell. And obviously there is the daedra issue, I fight them, I don't serve them.
- She is the one bringing the desperate into even deeper trouble. There is nothing positive about her follower's eating habits either. Cannibalism is not a good way to live.
