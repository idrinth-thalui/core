# Lorkhan.

- He is the one bringing us this existence. I'm unsure if I should be thankful or angry about it, since he reduced us. His heart is likely the most interesting artefact that I have ever heard of. It can create new godlike beings and make entire races disappear.
- The god of mankind. He is the one getting the Aedra to create Mundus. In turn it robbed them and us of power. I hope Auri-El's promise of returning to a state of timelessness will at some point come true. It would resolve so many conflicts, if the mer were to return to where we came from.
- As the father of Nirn, he is the one giving us this existance. His heart was taken from him by my angry ancestors. It created the three god Tribunal for the dunmer later on. I'm unsure if his betrayal is a blessing or a curse. I enjoy living in Tamriel on most days.
