# Lorkhan.

- He is the one bringing us this existence. I'm unsure if I should be thankful or angry about it, since he reduced us. His heart is likely the most interesting artefact that I have ever heard of. It can create new godlike beings and make entire races disappear.
- The god of menkind. He is the one getting the Aedra to create Mundus. In turn it robbed them and us of power. I hope Auri-El's promise of returning to a state of timelessness will at some point come true. It would resolve so many conflicts, if the mer were to return to where we came from.
