# Talos.

- While most mer believe Talos to just be a human, he certainly has godly powers. He is for all intents and purposes a champion of mankind, the equivalent of Trinimac in my mind. That his worship is forbidden is a crime at best. I can understand the anger it causes.
- You are asking a mer about the hero-god of mankind. The one who destroyed our lands and cities with the Nurmidium. I can understand his followers, but it feels as bad as Daedra worship to me.
- Having seen his war crimes, it makes me uneasy when meeting his followers. Most of them don't seem to be that destructive and rather honourable warriors, but a bit of doubt always remains. It must be as difficult for you, as a human, to work with me.
