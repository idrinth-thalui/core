# Mara.

- Mara is a difficult one to comment on. Love, her main topic, and marriage are both two edged swords. Can't say we are better off without her though.
- The Atmorans referred to her as Handmaiden of Kyne, and implied her being one of Shor's concubines. I would not mention that to her priesthood.
- I'm not sure if she blessed or cursed me. I found the love of my life, but lost her. Her power is great, maybe one of the greatest. I think it's just underestimated because it's rather suptle.
