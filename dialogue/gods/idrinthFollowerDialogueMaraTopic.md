# Mara.
- Mara is a difficult one to comment on. Love, her main topic, and marriage are both two edged swords. Can't say we are better off without her though.
- The Atmorans referred to her as Handmaiden of Kyne, and implied her being one of Shor's concubines. But I would not mention that to her priesthood.
