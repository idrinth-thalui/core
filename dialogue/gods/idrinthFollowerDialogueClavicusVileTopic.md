# Clavicus Vile.

- For a Daedra he is not so bad. You can't rely on him not harming you, but he keeps his promises. Literally. So mind the exact words of the deal. I would rather make deals with his companion if I had to.
- I'm glad I never made a pact with him. He will find a way to turn your words against you while fulfilling his promise. Fullfilling his promise in the worst possible way for the reciever.
