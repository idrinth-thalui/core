# Trinimac.

- Trinimac is the god I serve. He was betrayed and his corrupted form is followed by the Orsimer. In his original form he is a warrior-champion of mer.
- Trinimac is the champion of mer. He is the one who brought light back into my life after dark years. I've served him faithfully ever since.
- The champion of Auri-El is a difficult god. While he protects elven kind, he hates mankind. At least that is what we are told. For all my years serving him, he never appeared to drive me to slaughter men. I see him as a protector first and foremost.
