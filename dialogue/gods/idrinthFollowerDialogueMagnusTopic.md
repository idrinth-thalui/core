# Magnus.
- He is an important god to me. I practice his arts and his good will is not something to scuff at. He is one of the gods that most Altmer should follow, given our talent for magic.
- He turned his back on Nirn after Lorkhan bound the other gods to it's creation, leaving to Aetherius though the hole we now call the sun. Yet still we can feel his power.
