- I would be interested in hearing more about your homeland.
- You may look out of place to most, but you will find your way.
- Rare to me to not be the one standing out. No offence meant.
- I would love to hear more about your race.
- Do you follow the revered entities of Tamriel? Or are your gods different from ours?
- You must feel alone, being the only one of your kind around.
- I would love to hear more about your people's cuisine.
- What kind of beverages do you prefer? Do you even have alcoholic drinks in your homeland?
- How was your childhood?
- How does your homeland looks like?
- What kind of animals roam your homeland?
- Which plants grow there? Any familiar ones here in Skyrim?
- Which language do you speak at home?
- I apologise if I appear to be too curious. I never saw someone like you.
