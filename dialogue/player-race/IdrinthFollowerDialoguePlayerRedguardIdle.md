- Which part of Hammerfell do you hail from?
- Skyrim's winter is worse than the coldest Alik'r desert night.
- I haven't been in Hammerfell since the Great War. I would not be welcome now.
- I remember the first time I had Shrieking Cheese. I laughed so hard...
- Your traditional toad muffins taste almost like Dunmeri frog muffins.
- You should try the Bosmer take on traditional Redguard kabob.
- Your people are held in high regard here. After all, you defeated the Thalmor.
- Do you favour the Forebears or Crowns? Or no political side at all?
- I wonder which of us stands out more in the snow.
- You Redguards do love horses. They are not my favourite kind of mount.
