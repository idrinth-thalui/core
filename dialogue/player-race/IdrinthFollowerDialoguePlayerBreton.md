- So, you are from High Rock, I presume?
- The nobility in High Rock reminds me of the Altmer nobility back in my youth.
- What is your opinion about the Forsworn?
- I did see Tiber Septim once, from afar. If he was a Nord, he was a very short one.
- Did you ever get called pointy ears by a Nord?
- I think it's a tragedy your Forsworn cousins follow the Daedric Princes their Ayleid masters worshipped.
- Your people have been though a lot - too elven for most humans, too human for elves.
- I guess if Skyrim breaks free from the Empire, High Rock will follow suit?
- You do not have any volcanic reaper peppers with you, by chance?
- Had a halibut soup in Daggerfall once. I still remember the exquisite taste.
- I do not need any fancy food like fox or lark tongues. Do you?
- Which city state are you from?
