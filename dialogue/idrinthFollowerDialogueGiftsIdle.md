## Skooma

- You should keep your poison, I don't want it!
- Skooma and Moonsugar aren't anything I desire!
- Throw it away! Now!

## Sweet Rolls

- You should gift sweets to children, not to adults...
- I'd rather not weaken my bite with that much sugar...
- Why not give it to someone who doesn't need teeth?

## Blood Potion

- Thank you for taking care of my hunger.
- I appreciate the gesture, thank you!
- I hope you didn't kill an innocent to get the blood!

## Alto Wine

- Thank you for the vine, I'll enjoy it.
- It's weird that you would part with a good vintage like this!
- Are you certain you want to part with wine?

## Healing Potion

- I'm grateful you want to keep me alive!
- I'll return the favour soon!
- Trinimac be thanked, his blessing on you!

## Mead

- Ah, some fine liquor, I'll have it with dinner!
- Not my favourite, but I'll enjoy the mead none the less.
- Why not share the mead later?

## Stamina Potion

- Oh, very nice. More endurance will help.
- I'll use that for sure!
- May I never run out of blade swings!

## Magicka Potion

- Ah, extra magicka, let me know when you need healing!
- Perfect, now I can heal even longer!
- Not bad at all! I'll drain our enemies!

## Dwarven Crossbow

- A fine weapon, but you can use it more than me!
- Not something I'd use, but it's well made. Why don't you keep it?
- I think this will be more use to you!

## Garlic

- I guess we'll have garlic soup tonight!
- Didn't plan on garlic, but it should fit our dinner.
- You don't believe in garlic killing vampires, do you?
- Nice, that garlic should make the food more tasty!
