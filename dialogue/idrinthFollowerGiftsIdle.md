## Skooma

- You should keep your poison, I don't want it!
- Skooma and Moonsugar aren't anything I desire!

## Sweet Rolls

- You should gift sweets to children, not to adults...
- I'd rather not weaken my bite with that much sugar...

## Blood Potion

- Thank you for taking care of my hunger.
- I appreciate the gesture, thank you!

## Alto Vine

- Thank you for the vine, I'll enjoy it.
- It's weird, that you would part with a good vintage like this!
