## Skooma

- You should keep your poison, I don't want it!
- Skooma and Moonsugar aren't anything I desire!

## Sweet Rolls

- You should gift sweets to children, not to adults...
- I'd rather not weaken my bite with that much sugar...

## Blood Potion

- Thank you for taking care of my hunger.
- I appreciate the gesture, thank you!

## Alto Vine

- Thank you for the vine, I'll enjoy it.
- It's weird that you would part with a good vintage like this!

## Healing Potion

- I'm grateful you want to keep me alive!
- I'll return the favor soon!

## Mead

- Ah, some fine liquor, I'll have it with dinner!
- Not my favourite, but I'll enjoy the mead none the less.

## Stamina Potion

- Oh, very nice. More endurance will help.
- I'll use that for sure!

## Magicka Potion

- Ah, extra magicka, let me know when you need healing!
- Perfect, now I can heal even longer!

## Dwarven Crossbow

- A fine weapon, but you can use it more than me!
- Not something I'd use, but it's well made. Why don't you keep it?
