- Some fresh air, finally!
- Glad to be out of the city!
- I wonder how long this land will survive as free as it is.
- I prefer roaming the plains over the cities.
- A nice stroll in the woods...
- What a beautiful night sky.
- In the mood for a little hunting trip?
- I prefer being out here.
- Cities are fine to visit, but I feel more at home here.
- Here I do not get all those contempt looks.
- Do you smell that? The sweet scent of wildflowers.
- Just stand still for a moment and listen to the birds singing their songs.
- Being away from the main roads is risky, but worthwile.
- Some roads are frequented by the Thalmor. I prefer not to run into them.
- There is no bad weather. Only bad preparation.
- What do you prefer? Grassy plains or deep woods?
