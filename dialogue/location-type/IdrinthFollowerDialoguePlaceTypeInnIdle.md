- Nothing against a drink or too. But don't overdo it.
- Do all bards learn Ragnar the Red as their first song?
- Quite comfy here. A good rest replenishes our strenght.
- I wonder how long it takes for a drunk customer to call me a Thalmor spy?
- The inns in Skyrim feel even more cosy when the weather outside is bad.
- A hearty stew with meat amnd vegetables is always perfect to warm your belly. Except for Bosmer, of course.
