- Smells like an animal den.
- Spiderwebs! Last time they got stuck in my beard!
- You'll often find mushrooms in here. Make sure to gather them.
- Ah, away from that unpleasant weather.
- I wonder how big this cave is.
- Which kind of animal lurks here?
- Smells like more than one inhabitant.
- Great. Spiderwebs. I hate spiderwebs.
- ONE cave without spiderwebs. Stars above, is that too much to ask for?
- Let's see who's lair we entered.
- Ere we rest, we should check out the cave. I do not like to be surprised by a bear.
