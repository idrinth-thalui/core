- Beware of the chaurus. Their poison is vicious.
- Gather all chaurus eggs you can find. Less of them hatching and swarming around.
- How far have you fallen, my kinsmen?
- People think they are some kind of goblins. They are not.
- The once proud Snow Elves, reduced to mere animals... it breaks my heart.
- Xarxes ceased to record their lives ages ago.
- What evil fate befell you, kinsmen?
- Gathering Falmer ears feels like cannibalism. Even if they are reduced to mere animals.
- Their souls have turned white. *sigh*
- The Snow Elves who fell under Ysgramor's onslaught were the lucky ones.
- What twisted fate made the Falmer tame these chaurus?
- I do hope whatever changed the Falmer is not in these caverns anymore.
- I heard a Dunmer alchemist telling her children they will turn into Falmer if they eat too many Falmer ears.
- Someone actually wrote a book about cooking chaurus. Xarxes' backside, why?
- Be careful, chaurus and Falmer can climb the walls.
- Ancestors have mercy with you, kinsmen.
- Stars above, seeing them always breaks my heart.
- To think that those noble Snow Elves I saw as a child could be one of them now...Lorkhan!
- The Falmer are good at cultivating mushrooms.
- These mushroom gardens... I heard of their old ice gardens, full of flowers. I wish I could have seen them.
