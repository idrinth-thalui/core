- You are not trying to lock me in, are you?
- Not very secure, is it?
- A waste of space, either a crime is worth a fine, a banishment or death.
- Most prisons are filled with people who had to steal to survive.
- And why are these ones imprisoned?
- Avoid serving jail time in Solitude. I mean it.
- I heard of prisoners being forgotten in the Chill for years.
- Cidhna Mine is rumoured to be the safest prison in Skyrim. I doubt that. Every mine has it's secret tunnel.
- The Riften jail is a joke. Not one real thief in there.
- Those jail bars remind me of some bad times in my life.
- Caged like animals...
