- I'm not cut out for farm work. But I appreciate the farmers.
- Hard work, hard life. Even harder with the civil war. And now dragons...
- I admire their courage not to seek shelter in one of the fortified cities.
- Good the crops are still growing.
- Horse manure and cow dung... oh, well, I smelled worse.
- Without the farmers Skyrim would be lost.
- They are always looking for helping hands. One way to earn septims.
- Many farms have lost two generations of farmers already.
- I have seen  several farms burned to the ground by bandit groups.
- Be thankful for these men and women.
- A cabbage field... I prefer wheat.
- They keep goats. I can smell them.
- If you want fresh vegetables, buy them directly from the farmers.
