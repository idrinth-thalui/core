- May their rest not be disturbed by a filthy necromancer.
- The dead are never fully gone as long as we remember them. *sigh*
- Wish I could visit her grave once more...
- So much sadness in this place.
- This war will add many more graves, I fear.
- Moments like this remind me of my eternal fate...
- So many graves...
- Have you seen how many children were buried recently?
- All those young people, lying in the ground instead of cherishing their lifes.
- May the Ancestors protect their rest.
- May Xarxes have recorded all your deeds.
- I failed you twice, my dearest Arlinve...
- Do you want a moment to pray for the departed?
