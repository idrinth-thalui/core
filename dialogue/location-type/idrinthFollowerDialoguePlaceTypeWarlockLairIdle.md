- Warlocks are near, it smells of old books!
- I've never seen a group of warlocks without an elf.
- No wonder the Nords of Skyrim fear magic. Between the Thalmor and these rogue apprentices...
- Keep an eye out for scrolls and spell tomes.
- Is that all you got? Pathetic!
- Warlocks. Mostly those mages who strife for power without wanting to actually work hard for it.
- How many college dropouts do we have here?
- Wonderful - another bunch of self-proclaimed masters of magic.
- Many of them are self-taught. I am amazed they can conjure creatures from Oblivion without them turning on their conjurers.
- Warlocks. Again. Trinimac, why?
- Syrabane curse you all, you pathetic pretenders!
- The best about warlocks is that they hoard any magic-related items they can get their greedy hands on.
- Do look out for rare ingredients. You'd be amazed what warlocks have in their satchels.
- Syrabane enlighten these dumb fools!
- Lorkhan take these pesky warlocks!
