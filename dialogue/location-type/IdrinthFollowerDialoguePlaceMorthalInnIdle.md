- I never tried toad muffins. Maybe Jonna will make some?
- I would not be surprised if Stros M'kai grilled seagulls will be offered on holidays. They sometimes fly all up from the sea.
- Do I smell garlic greens? No, just a normal stew.
- Redguard cuisine uses scorpions a lot. Could they be replaced by chaurus? Too strange for your taste?
- Nords tend to eat their food less seasoned than redguards. A pity.
- Potato soup...again. Any chances of cheese fries for variety?
- Mead is fine, but I wish Jonna sells pomegrenade wine. Been quite some time since I drank one.
- Jonna should try to sell kabobs - plenty of meat sources around the city, and mushrooms will add a special Morthal taste.
- We should order venison pie, seasoned like in Hammerfell. It will drive away the cold.
- If Lurbuk ever orders a bratwurst on bun, by Trinimac, I will make sure it is properly grilled, not cooked.
