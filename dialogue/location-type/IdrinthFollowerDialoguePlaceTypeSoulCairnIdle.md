- A very depressing place, indeed.
- Trinimac guard us in this wasteland.
- The air tingles with twisted magicka.
- Can you hear them? Countless souls lost in the mist, their screams reduced to a murmur.
- The Soul Cairn is rumored to be the place soul-trapped beings end up. A horrible fate.
- I hope I don't meet anyone I know.
- What a desolate realm...
- Great stars, i hope I never end up here!
- Trinimac, preserve us from this dishonoured fate.
- You see these wisps? I fear these are souls shrivelled to nothingness.
- This unworldly graveyard frightens me.
- These mists never were chased away by Auri-El's light...
- Great stars... may we escape from here again.
- I think I knew that one. From back in the Second Era.
- An eerie light around here...
- These lightning bolts rattle my nerves.
- I feel it hard to keep track of time here.
- I liked lavender. After this - not anymore. Strange colour.
- These bone heaps are depressing.
- Are these bones the reamains of those trapped here alive?
- That ghost looked familiar.
- Another of these black skeletons around?
- These cairn stones all look the same.
- Are you sure we go in the right direction?
- I can feel a presence watching me...
- At least we're not in Coldharbour or the Deadlands.
