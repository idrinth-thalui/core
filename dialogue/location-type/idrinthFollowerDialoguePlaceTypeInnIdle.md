- Finally some rest...
- I could really use some wine.
- I'll see you later!
- I'll get myself something to drink.
- Ah, good to be in a warm, dry place.
- You look tired. Better rent a bed.
- Fancy anything special today? I'll ask what's on the menu.
- Nothing against a drink or too. But don't overdo it.
- Do all bards learn Ragnar the Red as their first song?
- Quite comfy here. A good rest replenishes our strength.
- I wonder how long it takes for a drunk customer to call me a Thalmor spy?
- The inns in Skyrim feel even more cosy when the weather outside is bad.
- A hearty stew with meat and vegetables is always perfect to warm your belly. Except for Bosmer, of course.
- I should go to bed soon.
- Don't stay up too long.
- The sun rises early. We should be ready then.
- I feel the snow on my back melting.
