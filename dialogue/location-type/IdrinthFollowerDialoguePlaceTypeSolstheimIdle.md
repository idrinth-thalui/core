- Before the Red Mountain erupted, the southern pine woods were as lush as the ones in Falkreath.
- The only difference between Solstheim and the Skyrim mainland were the rieklings.
- Most plants were brought over by the Dunmer, for only they can thrive in the ash.
- Quite a lot of Morrowind creatures can be found.
- The ash in the air makes breathing difficult.
- Shortly after the Red Year there were many months here when you couldn't see the sun.
- Take care, the snow is mingled with ash.
- Netches sometimes appear on the shores of Solstheim before the red Year. Now they are a common sight.
- Beware the ash hoppers, they hide underneath it.
- I wonder if we meet a wild kagouti?
- Some merchants use guars as riding animals. Dunmer think horses are food.
- As you can see, Morrowind fauna thrives.
- Amazing that some trees are still alive.
- This island has the questionable honour of being the chosen location of several Hunts of Hircine.
- I wonder if Thirsk mead hall still stands?
- In olden times frost giants roamed the northern shores.
- This island was the place of the last battle of the Snow Elves. After that, only a handful survived.
- If we find the final resting place of the Snow Prince, I will pray for the lost souls of his people.
- My northern cousins were so thoroughly beaten, not even the name of their last prince is remembered.
- Werebears are rumoured to be more common here than on the mainland.
- An old legend claims Solstheim was parted from Skyrim through the power of a dragon priest. Strange story. (Stops after Vahlok the Jailer)
- Wolfsbane once grew here. I doubt the plants survived the ash storms.
- Lunar wolves were amongst the races that went extinct. They were originally bred by the Snow Elves.
- Netches are docile, but do not provoke them.
- Nix hounds seem to take the place of wolves.
