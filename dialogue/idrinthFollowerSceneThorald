After exiting Northwatch Keep, without Avulstein


T: Wait. Aren't you the Elf who helped us with the skeever? And you just freed me from your fellow Thalmor?
I: The Thalmor are my enemies, too. They hate me way more than they could ever hate you.
T: Oh. Never thought that there were High Elves that were against the monsters...
I: Sadly, most Nords don't. But hold still for a moment, I will tend your wounds...
T: Wha..! Wait, no, not again... sorry. I... some bad memories.
I: I know. They like to keep their prisoners up for interrogation as long as possible. I am sorry you had to endure it.
T: Thanks... you know an awful lot about them.
I: I have seen much since they took over the Isles. Nothing of it was good.
T: That was a long time ago, right?
I: During the Great Anguish. You call it the Oblivion Crisis.
T: Wait, so long ago? How old are you?
I: Much older than you think.
T: By the Nine, are all High Elves this old?
I: No. But there are still some on active duty who remember the Crisis. And a handful who remember Tiber Spetim.
T: Did you saw Tiber Septim?
I: Once. And his Imperial Battlemage. From afar.
T: By the gods...
I: A word of advice: Be careful around the higher ranked Thalmor. They had centuries to hone their skills.
T: I thought they were just bandits in black...I will heed your advice.
I: Make sure to reach Windhelm safe and sound. Or your mother will never stop blaming me.
T: Oh, I will. And make sure she gets my message.

T: Oh. Never thought that there were High Elves that were against the monsters...
A: Some are on our side, brother. I was surprised, too. And I appreciate it.
I: Sadly, most Nords don't. But hold still for a moment, I will tend your wounds...
