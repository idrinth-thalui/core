## Well fed

- You look as if you could rip out trees... metaphorical speaking of course.
- I'm sure you could eat more, but it's a bad idea!

## Satisfied

- You seem pretty sated, that is a good start!
- You look energetic!

## Peckish

- Why not eat an apple? Fresh and juicy should be refreshing!
- You are near your maximum combat capabilities, but not quite there...

## Hungry

- Are you sure you don't want to eat something?
- A bit of bread perhaps? You look like you could use it...

## Famished

- We should find an inn soon, you need to eat!
- I don't have much to offer, but maybe you want to try some wolves' feed?

## Starving

- Are you sure you are fine? Even your eyes look hungry...
- I can hear your empty stomach and so can enemies!
