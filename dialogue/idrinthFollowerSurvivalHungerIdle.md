## Well fed

- You look as if you could rip out trees... metaphorical speaking of course.

## Satisfied

- You seem pretty sated, that is a good start!

## Peckish

- Why not eat an apple? Fresh and juicy should be refreshing!

## Hungry

- Are you sure you don't want to eat something?

## Famished

- We should find an inn soon, you need to eat!

## Starving

- I can hear your empty stomach and so can enemies!
