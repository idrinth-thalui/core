- A sailor of some kind? Curious how you ended up here.
- A pirate? I guessed as much, but didn't guess you're a captain.
- Serano? That is a Dunmer family. Was your father a Dunmer, if I may ask?
- Your mannerism is an interesting blend of Redguard corsairs and Dunmer seafarers.
- I do hope you do not plan on betraying us. You won't like my answer.
- Care for a glass of sujamma?
- Just how many noble Breton ladies swoon at your sight?
- You remind me of a book cover I've seen  a few hundred years ago. An... interesting book.
- If you want us to sing some sea shantys: I do not sing.
