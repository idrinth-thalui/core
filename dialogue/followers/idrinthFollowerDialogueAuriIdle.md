- I'm so glad, that you are following the Green Pact!
- Would you mind sharing some of our enemies?
- You make a dangerous enemy, your bow is deadly!
- I must say, your interpretation of the Green Pact reminds me of my own set of rules.
- In your eyes, Auri, what would be the best target for us to hunt next?
- Wounderful, stuck between two wood elves...
- Poor Auri, she'll risk her neck looking up to us...
- It must be hard for you to be  far away from home.
- What is your favourite prey?
- I could try to make some Bosmer Bites, if you want.
- Your home woods are beautiful. I miss them, too.
- You may be small in size, but a giant in ferociousness.
- I hope you do not join the Wild Hunt while we are near?
- Have you ever met the Silvenar?
- Your Thistlefoot is a fine antelope.
