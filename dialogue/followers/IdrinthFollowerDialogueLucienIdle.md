- Ah, a young aspiring explorer from Cyrodiil. Blessings of Trinimac on you. I am Idrinth.
- A bit nervous, our new companion. Don't you worry, I will protect you with my blade.
- So you want to explore the depths and hidden secrets of Skyrim? Beware, young man, they can be darker than you wish.
- You may not be the best battlemage I've seen, but you have courage. Admirable.
- Do not fret about how you fought the last time. Not everyone faces danger head on with blade swinging.
- Still up to exploring all of Skyrim, young man? Draugr are not easy to face.
- Flavius...a very old family name. Related to the Flavius family of Kvatch back from the time of Reman?
- That, dear Lucien, was a deer. No need to look out for trouble.
- You held your ground well in that fight.
- I suggest more training with an actual weapon. Magicka can always be drained, and then you are powerless.
- Learn more spells, Lucien. It should be easy for a bright lad like you.
- It feels good to see such an innocent soul in these dark times.
- Are you alright, Lucien? That dragon was quite the sight - and quite the challenge.
- I have seem many things in my time - but I never thought dragons would return.
- I can feel your eyes on me. Is there anything I can help you with? Answer your questions?
- The Dwemer were fascinating. I remember them, though I rarely met them.
- Ah, I miss the times when the Snow Elves still roamed this land...I miss the times the Paragons of Trinimac visited the Isles.
- I do not mind to answer any questions you have, Lucien. I have seen more things than you imagine.
- It always grieves my heart when I see those twisted shadows of the once proud Snow Elves...
- Ah, Nords. Still as headstrong as their Atmoran ancestors. I wonder whom of us they fear more?
- The city of Ysgramor. It had seen better times. You should have seen it.
- I wish you'd have seen Winterhold in it's prime. I remember a cozy little inn right on the cliff's edge... all gone now.
- If you ever want to know more about Altmer religion and history, I will gladly answer.
- Do not worry, Lucien. I will not drink your blood. On my honour as follower of Trinimac.
