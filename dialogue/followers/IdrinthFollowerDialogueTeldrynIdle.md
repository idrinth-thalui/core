- You're from Blacklight? A truly magnificent city, the pride of House Redoran.
- Glad to have a seasoned fighter at my side.
- A little ease on the flame spells, my Dunmer friend...
- Ah, yes, Jiub. Helped him once to clear out a cliff racer colony pestering the farmfolk.
- Wish you could have seen the old Dwemer cities in their old glory.
- Excellent swordsmanship there, my Dunmer friend.
- By Trinimac, I assure you I'm not one of those filthy bloodsuckers.
- We should share battle stories by a bottle of Sujamma.
- How fares Morrowind after the Red Year? The Red Mountain is still more active than ever before.
- I take it you defended Blacklight during the Argonian Invasion?
- You're worth every septim, my Dunmer friend.
- Whoa, Teldryn, watch where you summon your flame atronach!
