- A noble task, fighting against the corruption of Riften.
- Wonder who named you Lioness.
- You're putting honour first, like a true Nord should be. Most do not.
- Care for some sparring? I can teach you a few moves.
- Venturing into a Dwemer ruin alone - that was brave. And foolish.
- So...Aerin saved you. Quite the tale.
- You wield a fine blade. May it last longer than my glass sword.
- You're very tolerant towards other races. A rare trait for Nords, and a welcomed one.
- If you'd be an Altmer, you would make a fine warrior of Trinimac.
- Aerin seems to be very solicitous around you.
