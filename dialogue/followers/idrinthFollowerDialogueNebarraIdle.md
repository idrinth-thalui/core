- Hey Nebarra, are you sure you don't have Bosmer blood in you? You are so small!
- It's fun fighting side by side with another Altmer. Just wish you were a better warrior.
- Not sure if Trinimac would approve of your weapon choice, Nebarra!
- Don't hurt Nebarra! He still needs to grow!
- Here, take a healing potion, you look like you could use one!
- Don't worry, I'll protect you, Nebarra!
- How many bandits did you kill, Nebarra?
