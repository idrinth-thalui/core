- Hey Nebarra, are you sure you don't have Bosmer blood in you? You are so small!
- It's fun fighting side by side with another Altmer. You still have room for improvement though.
- Not sure if Trinimac would approve of your weapon choice, Nebarra!
- Don't hurt Nebarra! He still needs to grow!
- Here, take a healing potion, you look like you could use one!
- Don't worry, I'll protect you, Nebarra!
- How many bandits did you kill, Nebarra?
- It's fun fighting side by side with another Altmer. Want to spar later on, Nebarra?
- How does it feel having fought for the wrong side?
- I don't like your eating habits, it's strange at best...to eat with a helmet on.
- Want to see who kills a troll faster next time?
- You are spilling way too much of your drinks on your helmet, you need a bib!
- I'm curious, why not take off that helmet once in a while?
- How exactly do you eat with the helmet on? Don't you get food stuck?
- Isn't it uncomfortable to sleep with a helmet on? I even take my circlet off.
- Would you care for some wine later? Exchange some stories?
