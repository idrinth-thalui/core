- Be glad our mutual friend vouches for you, Thallery!
- I'm not sure why I don't gut you like a fish!
- The pride of the Thalmor fleeing his perfect life? Ludicrous!
- For what your family has done, you should have killed yourself!
- A dagger is a distasteful weapon, why not take a warrior's weapon, Thallery?
- The Pride of the Thalmor fleeing his life, as if...
- Not many can say, they actually left the Thalmor behind!
- I wonder why you don't use any magic, Thallery.
- I'm not sure if you are a wolf in sheep's clothing, Thallery.
- If you are serious about leaving the Thalmor, maybe this is your best chance.
- Maybe you should try and practice one of the magic arts, Caryalind?
- If you want to learn some proper weapon, I'll help you!
- Maybe you want to learn some tricks from me? They could come in handy!
- Your father is a dangerous man, you need to grow up to face him!
- We should spend some time talking about our, no, the Aldmeri's, history!
- You may be the light that is needed for the Altmer to survive.
- I should introduce you to my great-grand-Niece, you two may become allies.
