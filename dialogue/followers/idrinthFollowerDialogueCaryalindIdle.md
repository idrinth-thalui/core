- Be glad our mutual friend vouches for you, Thallery!
- I'm not sure why I don't gut you like a fish!
- The pride of the Thalmor fleeing his perfect life? Ludicrous!
- For what your family has done, you should have killed yourself!
- A dagger is a distasteful weapon, why not take a warrior's weapon, Thallery?
- The Pride of the Thalmor fleeing his life, as if...
- Not many can say, they actually left the Thalmor behind!
- I wonder why you don't use any magic, Thallery.
- I'm not sure if you are a wolf in sheep's clothing, Thallery.
- If you are serious about leaving the Thalmor, make hay while the sun shines.
- If you are serious about leaving the Thalmor, maybe this is your best chance.
- Maybe you should try and practice one of the magic arts, Caryalind?
- If you want to learn some proper weapon, I'll help you!
- Maybe you want to learn some tricks from me? They could come in handy!
- Your father is a dangerous man, you need to grow up to face him!
- We should spend some time talking about our, no, the Aldmeri's, history!
- You may be the light that is needed for the Altmer to survive.
- I should introduce you to my great-grand-niece, you two may become allies.
- I admit I misjudged you at first, Caryalind. It is an honour to fight with you.
- You could try learning a few healing spells. They are easier to learn and always useful.
- If you want to continue fighting with daggers, we should work on your evasion skills.
- I am always ready to spar with you, Caryalind. I can't let the only good Thallery die of sloppy fighting skills.
- You have a kind heart. A beacon of how we Altmer should strife to be.
- I'd be glad if we can sit down and talk about home. I haven't been to the Isles since the Great Anguish.
- Want to share a bottle of wine and tell me how our home fares? I long to see Alinor again.
- The Ancestors truly smile on you, Caryalind.
- Are all Oblivion Gates destroyed by now?
- Which is your favourite place back home? I always loved my aunt's orchard and her canahs.
- I miss the old wisteria grove from my parents' estate. Do you miss your quiet place, too?
- Which skies do you prefer, Cary? Skyrim's cold beauty or the Isles' jewels on velvet ground?
