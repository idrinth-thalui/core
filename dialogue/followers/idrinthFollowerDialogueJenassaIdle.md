- I do hope your eagerness does not spring from all too fervent devotion to the five times cursed one?
- Excellent work. You wield your blade well.
- Up for some sparring, Jenassa?
- You are a skilled fighter. But do not reduce yourself to it.
- You show great potential. If you ever want some advise, I am eager to teach you.
- Azura may guide you.
- By Trinimac, you are a fine warrior.
- I hope you prefer Azura over the... other ones.
- Your determination reminds me of a young Dunmer warrior I met back in the Second Age.
- You are good at merging in the shadows. Do not let them drain your honour.
