- So you're a Dagi-Raht. I am not surprised. Your magical talents are only surpassed by Alfiq.
- You wear Hammerfell garb and wield a scimitar. I assume you are not from Elsweyr?
- A lot of people will make the mistake to underestimate you. I will not.
- I do hope my being an Altmer will not make you hate me?
- Do not worry - bring no harm to me, and I will not harm you.
- Skyrim must look very cold to you. And I do not mean the weather.
- Any news from Hammerfell? I am not very welcome there.
