- A follower of five times cursed Boethiah? If it wasn't for my friend here, I would cut you down right here!
- Spare me your explanations, hil av daedra.
- I will watch you closely, servant of the Cursed One.
- Trinimac, grant me the strength to endure this ... cultist.
- Dare to compare me to those filthy bloodsuckers again, Varrick... by Trinimac, I'll kill you!
- Do not imply that I follow the Defiler, odioth! I serve the Champion of Auri-El!
- Varrick Veil. I will remember your name. For the day I carve it into your gravestone.
- A magic-using Follower of the Cursed One. Now that's something you don't see every day.
- Pathetic reflexes... that was only a hare running through the bushes.
- Let me guess - your magic prowess lies in Alteration and Alchemy? Silence and poison, just like your cursed Prince.
- Granted, you did look out for others back then. Does not mean I have to like you.
- See to it that your minion don't get in the way of my blade.
- Trinimac, the trials you sent me.. I will endure them, Champion of Auri-El.
- Don't you dare fighting behind me again, daedra lover. I don't trust you.
- If you have to pray to your beloved Cursed One, do it in silence.
- Do not worry. I will not stoop so low as to smite you in your sleep.
- Eat, rest, sleep. If I claim your head, it will be in fair duel. Such is the way of Trinimac.
- I do trust you not to sully our mutual friend's honour with killing me in my sleep?
- Your view of worship is quite... interesting. Sounds more like a follower of Malacath to me.
- No wonder most Boethiah cultists see you as a blasphemer - you would fit better into an Orsimer Trinimac cult. I know what I'm talking of.
- Never heard about this interpretation of Boethiah before. Maybe we can fight side by side against a mutual enemy.
- If you have to pray, please do it on the other end of the camp. And  quietly.
- Vampires. And starved ones. Best we take them out ere they endanger any innocents.
- I smell vampires. Be on your guard, Varrick. They would love to sacrifice you to their Prince.
- Hm - at least we have a common enemy in Molag Bal.
- Guess our common goal to protect our mutual friend here makes us ... frenemies?
- Let us make a truce. I will not attack you for your beliefs, and you will not attack me for mine.
- I will never like you, or your beliefs. But I acknowledge your prowess in battle. And your way of honour.
- Speaking of frostbite - ever seen a Falmer vampire? Now that is a nasty sight... makes you wish you're blind.
- Trinimac preserve me! Your constant jokes are growing on me!
- What did the Molag Bal cultist said to the Trinimac priest? Urrgl... stars above, did I just made a joke?
- First or second watch, Varrick?
- I never thought I would trust a Boethiah cultist. But you've proven your worth, Varrick.
- May Trinimac forgive me for liking you. But there is still good in your heart.
- By my ancestors, if you even dare thinking of betraying (player.alias)'s heart, I will hunt you through all realms of Oblivion.
- Please do not corrupt his/her heart, Varrick. He/she has a pure soul.
- I wish you both be happy. Savour your love while you can. It ends too soon too often...
- So, you were a farmer and father once... I am sorry for your loss.
- I understand now why you became the man you are. I, too, know the meaning of loss. I still miss her...
- Varrick, my friend, you are officially the least hated Boethiah cultist of Tamriel. At least where I'm concerned.
- Sometimes I wish I was a father. But the thought of leaving her alone with our child... It was better that way.
- Ah, Varrick, you should have tasted the honey wine of the Snow Elves. I loved the one with lavender and snowberries...
- To the ones we loved and lost. May they find eternal peace.
