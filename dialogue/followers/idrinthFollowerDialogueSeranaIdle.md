- Your father's court is quite special in how long it survived.
- Can't say I like your father, I'm glad you are less like him, Serana.
- A daughter of Coldharbour, eh, has been a while since I met one. I'm sorry you had to go through that.
- You missed a lot while you were hidden away, the Oblivion Crisis alone was interesting already.
- Not sure if it's a good idea to be that public about vampirism, Serana.
- You are followed by a vampire princess and a vampire paladin, sounds like a story.
- The sun is shining, let's wait for our princess to complain...
- Nice snowfall, not too heavy. You want to be in a cave now, right, Serana?
- You know, some fresh blood in your veins would do you good, Serana!
- I wonder, how much have you really seen in your unlife?
- You should have a look at Dunmeri drinks, Serana, they have a taste unlike most others!
- I recognise the style of your castle home, has been a while since that was popular...
