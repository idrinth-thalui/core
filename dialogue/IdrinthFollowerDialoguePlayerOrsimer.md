- Most folks might call you Orcs, but I have not forgotten your ancestry, cousin.
- Maybe you are a descendant of my uncle Sarcessar. He was a priest of Trinimac, when... you know.
- Have you been to one of the strongholds?
- Rare to see a female Orsimer outside a stronghold. Good for you.
- Most people think you're mindless brutes. I do not.
- A welcome change to fight alongside a follower of Trinimac's Wrath.
- It's been a long time I enjoyed a pink Zinfandel.
- Nord food is on the meat side - care for a no-rhubarb salad? With extra garlic?
- Most people here know Orsimer from the strongholds or the occational bandit.
- If you want to know more abot the history of Wrothgar - I know quite a bit.
- Do say if you want me to punish people calling you a giant goblin again.
