- Ere we visit the Jarl, I have to tell you that I know Ondolemar. Or at least, I did know him, back before the Oblivion Crisis.
- A very talented boy, well versed in both magic and warfare. Inherited from both his parents. Nobles like me.
- His father was captain of the King of Firsthold's personal guards, his mother Third Librarian in Crystal-like-Law. They both died in the Great Anguish.
- He joined the Thalmor and proved to be a successful tactician, veteran of many battles.
- He volunteered for this assignment, not like many other Thalmor.
