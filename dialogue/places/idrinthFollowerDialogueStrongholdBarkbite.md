- The Orsimer here are more similar to Bosmer than to their Malacath following kin.
- A young Stronghold, a friendly one. Let's hope it stands the test of time.
- They normally live in Valenwood. I presume they fled from the Thalmor.
- Last time I saw Wood Orsimer was in Valenwood, nearly 500 years ago.
- I heard that they forge most of the Bosmer's metal weapons.
- When the Ayleids fled before the Alessian Order, they invaded several settlements of Wood Orcs and Bosmer.
- I wouldn't be surprised if the Thalmor were driving them out of Valenwood systematically. They never liked Orsimer.
