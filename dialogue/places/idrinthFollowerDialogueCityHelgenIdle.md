- Helgen was always a favourite of mine, simple and strong.
- After Ulfric's rebellion the Legion tripled their presence and instated battle mages. I visited sparsely since then.
- I liked Vilod's mead with juniper berries.
- Most of the people here I knew as children. They were used to see Altmer in the Legion and wanted me to play with them.
- A terrible fate... may their souls find eternal rest.
- This was once the gate to Cyrodiil. Now it's only ruins.
- It must have been a harrowing experience for the few survivors.
- I heard some Imperial soldiers and Stormcloaks only survived by fleeing together.
- Elenwen was rumoured to be here the day of the attack. A pity she wasn't among the dead.
- Elenwen was said to have fled once the dragon appeared. Ondolemar would have stood his ground.
- If the Thalmor would have joined the fight, they could have saved some of the inhabitants. But Elenwen is a pampered coward.
- Some say that Ulfric called the dragon himself. If he could do that, he would have done it sooner.
- Some say the Thalmor called the dragon. If any Thalmor could call a dragon, all of Tamriel would know.
