- Markarth never changes, does it?
- The Temple of Dibella was once a shrine to Hircine.
- The Dwemer city looked different. It was rebuilt this way during the Alessian Empire.
- The Reachmen named the city Markarth. It means "above the Karth". Simple, yet concise.
- Tiber Septim founded the Imperial College of the Voice here. Wish it would still exist.
- Many come here for the temple.
- Nowadays more silver than blood flows here.
- The Grey Host once rampaged here - a vile army of undead. I'm glad I'm not one of them.
- Cidhna Mine is still open?
- Sometimes I'm startled at seeing humans here - my first visit was when the Dwemer were still here.
- I wonder if the Automatons in the Underkeep are still functional?
- I've shunned the city since High Justiciar Ondolemar was assigned here, after the "Markarth Incident".
