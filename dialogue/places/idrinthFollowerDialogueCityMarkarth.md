- Markarth never changes, does it?
- The Temple of Dibella was once a shrine to Hircine.
- The Dwemer city looked different. It was rebuilt this way during the Alessian Empire.
- The Reachmen named the city Markarth. It means "above the Karth". Simple, yet concise.
- Tiber Septim founded the Imperial College of the Voice here. Wish it would still exist.
- Many come here for the temple.
- Nowadays more silver than blood flows here.
- The Grey Host once rampaged here - a vile army of undead. I'm glad I'm not one of them.
- Cidhna Mine is still open?
- Sometimes I'm startled at seeing humans here - my first visit was when the Dwemer were still here.
- I wonder if the Automatons in the Underkeep are still functional?
- I've shunned the city since High Justiciar Ondolemar was assigned here, after the "Markarth Incident".
- Nchuand-Zel looked really different. I saw the city once after the Dwemer disappeared.
- Markarth. Above the Karth. A truly...human name.
- I used to visit the city frequently, but after the Markarth Incident it is not the safest place for me.
- Before the Great War I saw many a pilgrim visit the temple of Dibella. Now many fear travelling the roads.
- The Forsworn prevent a lot of trade for the city.
- The Forsworn would be wise not to attack Markarth while Ondolemar is here. He survived the battle for the Imperial City, fighting both the Legion and Naarifin's daedra.
- Markarth is as rotten as Riften. You just don't see it as well.
- Be careful not to commit any crimes here. Cidhna Mine is a harsh place.
- Most people who enter the mine only come out dead.
- Bothela is a kind woman, despite her looks.
- Bothela knows many ancient recipies, handed down from her ancestors.
- I wonder if the Silver-Bloods ever tried to bribe Ondolemar? No, they are still alive...
- One of the goals of the Forsworn is to turn the temple into a shrine of Hircine again.
- There are many whispered stories about the worship of Dibella. Guess someone mistook Dibella with Molag Bal.
- Rumours say the priestesses secretly worship Sanguine. Stars above, the imagination of some people!
- If Markarth should fall to the Forsworn, the Reach is lost.
- Igmund is a reasonable man. He does his best to protect his people.
- The Silver-Bloods are as bad as Maven Black-Briar.
- Do not let yourself be fooled by the still open temple of Talos. I heard of several worshippers who fell for Ondolemar's trap.
- The Silver-Bloods own most of the city.
- The Silver-Bloods are so hungry for power, they would renounce Talos if the Thalmor promise them all of Skyrim.
- I hope someone guards the gates of Nchuand-Zel. Who knows what still lurks beneath the city.
- You see the Reachmen's tattoos? They come from back in the day when their Ayleid masters marked them this way.
- Since the Silver-Bloods rose to power, the city is changing for the worst.
