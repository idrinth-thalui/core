- Ah, a typical Cornerclub. I take their variety of Dunmer cuisine is bigger than in Windhelm...
- Before you ask: No, Dunmer do not make beverages out of bugs.
- At times like this, I miss my wife... she'd love this Sujamma.
- Geldis looks more alert than your usual innkeeper. I guess he was a mercenary in his youth.
- I wonder if they got wickwheat bread?
- I have to ask for the famous Redoran style Hound and Rat pie. You barely taste the rat meat over the scuttle and kwama eggs.
- A good kwama egg quiche is always appreciated. Don't make me choose between it and a good garlic bread.
- I wonder if they have Spiced root cake?
- Nothing better to warm you up than an Ash yam and horker stew.
- Geldis Sadri clearly is not an innkeeper by trade. The way he scans the room... do not mess with him.
- I prefer not to drink Flin. I rather not give more money to the East Empire Trade Company.
- Geldis' Sujamma is truly five times blessed.
- I wonder if they can get their hands on Kaveh?
- Good they do not have any Greef. Last time I drank it, I had headaches for three days.
- What this Cornerclub needs is a good bard. One who is well versed in Dunmeri songs, of course.
- Ten septims that the roasted horse steak here tastes way better than in Skyrim... why are you looking at me like that? Dunmer think that guars are for riding.
- We should take some ingredients back to Windhelm. The Gray Quarter badly misses a lot of these delicacies.
- *sigh* This Sujamma would pair greatly with my wife's radish tartelettes.
- I'll have a Trama root tea. Calming and refreshing.
- If you don't buy these miners a round of Sujamma, I will. Their work is hard enough.
- I know many Chimer songs, but... I never was a good singer. And my favourite instrument is my greatsword.
