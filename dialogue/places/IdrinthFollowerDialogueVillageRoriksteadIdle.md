- Rich farmland - a blessing from the gods in wartorn times.
- This village was definitely not named after Rorik - I remember this place from the Second Age.
- I doubt that anyone here will name their son Ragnar.
- Not my favourite village, it feels odd.
- Quite impressive how the crops here are much richer than anywhere else in Skyrim. I do hope it's by the grace of the gods.
- I wonder if the original Rorikstead was abandoned and Rorik rebuild the settlement?
- There was a village named Lainalten nearby. Rorikstead used to be a single farm back then.
- Do they hunt bards out of town when they sing Ragnar the Red?
- Reldith reminds me of a woman back on the Isles, way before the Second Dominion. Loved her orchards.
- They have trouble with Forsworn from time to time. And every now and again, lonely travelers have gone missing.
- They'd be a lot safer with a wall. Or a palisade, at least.
- Between the Forsworn and the Civil War, they are quite relaxed here.
