- Rich farmland - a blessing from the gods in wartorn times.
- This village was definitely not named after Rorik - I remember this place from the Second Age.
- I doubt that anyone here will name their son Ragnar.
- Not my favourite village, it feels odd.
- Quite impressive how the crops here are much richer than anywhere else in Skyrim. I do hope it's by the grace of the gods.
- I wonder if the original Rorikstead was abandoned and Rorik rebuild the settlement?
- There was a village named Lainalten nearby. Rorikstead used to be a single farm back then.
- Do they hunt bards out of town when they sing Ragnar the Red?
- Reldith reminds me of a woman back on the Isles, way before the Second Dominion. Loved her orchards.
- They have trouble with Forsworn from time to time. And every now and again, lonely travellers have gone missing.
- They'd be a lot safer with a wall. Or a palisade, at least.
- Between the Forsworn and the Civil War, they are quite relaxed here.
- That Lemkil hates me since I stopped him beating his daughter like a madman. But he fears me too much to do something.
- Poor Sissel. Both her father and her sister Britte bully her all the time.
- The innkeeper's son kept me up all night last time I was here, begging for more stories. That boy yearns for adventure.
- Reldith tends this farm since the rebuild of the village. And it clearly shows.
- When Rorik claims this town to be named after him - he means they rebuild the old village.
- She may not look like it, but Reldith is over a century old. She used to work on a farm in the Reach ere moving here.
- People are amazed how well the crops grow here. But Reldith has been a farmer longer than Rorik lives.
- I heard Reldith plans on planting an orchard, once the Civil War is resolved.
