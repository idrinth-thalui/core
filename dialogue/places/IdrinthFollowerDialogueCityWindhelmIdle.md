- Ah, Windhelm, city of Ysgramor. Soaked with Snow Elven blood.
- The old stones still echo with the pain of their builders.
- Being here always makes me uneasy - and not because of drunken louts like Rolff.
- As shabby as it is, the Gray Quarter feels more homely to me.
- Care to join me in the New Gnisis Cornerclub? Been a while since I tasted genuine Morrowind cuisine.
- This really feels like home, it's racist enough.
- How many dead Snow Elves were buried in the walls? I still can sense their grief.
- I shudder to think over how many unmarked graves we walk. And most Nords do not even know...
- It's a cold city. Founded by Atmorans burning with hate for everything meric.
- The chill winds are as cold as the Nords hearts.
- How many people here are still haunted by the ghosts of old?
- As bitter and xenophobic the Nords here are - compared to Thalmor-ruled Altmer cities they are kind and welcoming.
- One day I will thank Rolff for his warm welcome of all Elves entering the city.
- Rolff Stone-Fist should learn a few things from the Thalmor, if he wants to harass foreigners. He's... about as scary as a puppy stumbling over it's paws.
- No wonder the Old Companions were so hateful. Living in constant Winter, in a city echoing with pain and grief...
- The Gray Quarter was once named the Snow Quarter. You can guess why.
- The Nords placed the Dunmer refugees in the poorest and coldest quarter.
- I like to visit the Gray Quarter. Most Dunmer living there do their best to have a good life.
- If you see orphaned children around - the ones who care for them are the Dunmer. regardless who the children are.
- Most Dunmer here are of the fallen House Hlaalu. I heard they fled as a group and live here for 190 years.
- I pity the Argonians in the harbour. Cold place, cold people...
- It is a hard live for the Argonians at the docks. They are not made for this cold weather.
- The Nords here treat the Argonians not much better than the Dunmer two centuries ago.
- It may sound strange, but the Altmer living here are treated better than the Dunmer.
- Nurelion the alchemist is a highly respected person. Niranye on the other hand...
- This Niranye seems suspicious. Fresh from the Isles, and free to sell her good openly in Windhelm? I seriously doubt that.
- I wonder what she is. A Thalmor spy? An Imperial agent? Someone more shady?
- Amazing how Rolff does not harass Niranye. I wonder if she pays him to leave her alone.
- I doubt Oengul War-Anvil is as good a blacksmith as Eorlund Gray-Mane. Even if they switch their forges.
