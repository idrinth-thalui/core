- A nice little village, I wish there were more of them.
- Watching the stream from the jetty is relaxing.
- Bleak Falls Barrow really towers over it. I wonder if that was intentional?
- The innkeeper is quite the nosy one. Guess not everyone likes Altmer.
- That feisty Breton sure has a problem with Altmer - she watches me all the time when I'm in the inn. I guess some bad memories.
- The inn's cook has some interesting dishes, if you're feeling adventurous.
- I'm rarely staying overnight, but the beds are good.
- Good range of shops for a village this small.
