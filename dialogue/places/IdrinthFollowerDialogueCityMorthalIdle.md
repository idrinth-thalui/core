- I wonder how many people think of the Thalmor when they hear the name Morthal for the first time?
- Legend says that Aumriel, a Pale Lady haunts the moors at night. A lost Snow Elf soul, perhaps?
- This constant mist is depressing.
- Too soggy for my taste, but a thriving garden for any alchemist.
- A nice city, but somehow too calm and quiet.
- The Jarl here is special, her whole family is.
- Lami is quite versed in alchemy, be sure to browse her shop from time to time.
- Falion has a shop here, if you're looking for new scrolls or books.
- I may not like Falion, but he'll buy those surplus staves off you.
- Morthal is said to be named after Morihaus Breath-of-Kyne. I only heard of him.
- Swamps are not my favourite place, but the city is acceptable.
- You find many kinds of mushrooms around here. But watch out for predators.
- What I hate about this town are the spiders thriving in the swamps around it.
- It is safer to buy local ingredients in Lami's shop. Outside spiders and chaurus are prowling.
- There are times I prefer the swamp to the inn. Especially when Lurbuk sings.
- Do not fear the Jarl. Idgrod may sound like she's touched by Sheogorath, but she has the gift of visions. Though I imagine it to be a curse sometimes.
- The fog and humidity from the swamp danpens the mood.
- Last year I stepped out of the inn and right into a frostbite spider. Not a nice way to start your day.
- As small as it is, the city feels welcoming after crossing the swamp.
- Be careful when leaving Morthal. I encountered chaurus close to it before.
- Whichever deity watches over Morthal be praised that no Falmer lurk nearby.
- This city has a strange feeling. Something dangerous lurks nearby. (before Laid to Rest)
- By Trinimac....for a moment I thought I felt another vampire. (before Laid to Rest)
- Something evil roams the swamp. I can sense it. (before Laid to Rest)
- The city feels safer now. The evil presence is gone. (after Laid to Rest)
- A dark cloud has been lifted from Morthal. (after Laid to Rest)
- Even the predators nearby are more peaceful now. (after Laid to Rest)
- You feel it too? The people are less frightened. (after Laid to Rest)
