- My favourite kind of place! I like the service here!
- Guess they didn't find the way to Sovngarde.
- Isn't there a saying about sleeping when you are dead? They clearly don't know it.
- I'm sure we'll meet draugr soon.
- I've been in such crypts before. The draugr sure are restless now.
- They must have awakened with their old dragon masters.
- Were those not walking the halls the ones following the Nordic gods?
- The candles are lit. The draugr are awake.
- I wonder how many of the draugr did want to become one?
- Dozens of draugr patrolling the crypt, and none of them bothers to clear up the spiderwebs!
- They wander around day and night. They could do something about those webs.
- Lorkhan! I ran into a spiderweb again!
- Draugr and traps. Keep an eye out for both.
- Are those traps here to keep people out of the crypt or the draugr inside?
- The draugr should know where their own traps are.
- Twenty septims the next draugr walks into a trap.
- Why do draugr let skeevers live inside their crypts? Skeever chew anything. Including draugr.
- What's around the next corner? Draugr? A trap? Spiderwebs? All three?
