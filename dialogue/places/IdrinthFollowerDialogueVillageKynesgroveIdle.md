- Kyne's Grove once was home to a great shrine to Kyne, tended by the Keepers of the Grove.
- Building a lumber mill here... the name could've given them a clue.
- There was an arena here. Wonder where it's gone?
- Did you know that this place also bore the name of Dragonwood?
- So Sahloknir was the reason this place was called Dragonwood.
- The Grove was much larger once, with many old, majestic trees.
- This was always the lushest place in Eastmarch.
- Between snow-covered Windhelm and the Aalto surrounded by hot springs...Eastmarch is truly a province of extremes.
- I remember when Kjeld was a little kid. He loved to hear stories. That stopped after the Great War broke out.
- Pilgrims do not come here anymore. A pity. The Nords are forgetting their old faiths.
- The mine keeps the village alive. I haven't seen pilgrims here since before the Great War.
- If you do not like Windhelm, spend the night here. The Braidwood Inn is more welcoming than Candlehearth Hall.
- This village was once famous for it's special brand of Alto wine. Sadly, that was before the Oblivion Crisis...
