- I like the coast here, the sea reminds me of old times.
- This city's life never seems to fade, even under current circumstances.
- Dawnstar - the thriving heart of the Pale. Admittedly, there's not much else...
- The harbour was always thriving - being between Solitude and Windhelm.
- Since Skyrim rebelled, ships from Roscrea are a rare sight.
- With two mines and the harbour, Dawnstar survived many a hard time.
- Centuries ago this town was an exile post garrison.
- When the wind blows from Atmora, it gets very cold.
- I get the Vesuvius family still lives here - they are the oldest resident family. And one of them was part of the Mythic Dawn.
- I haven't seen any Ice tribe attacks since the Crisis. I guess they are all dead.
- This town has seen several great battles.
- The sun rising in the crisp morning mist is one of my favourite sights.
- I remember Frida being a young apprentice to her parents.
- Frida knows all about frost-related illnesses. The more tragic she could not save her husband.
- Dawnstar is drained by the war - every able man and woman is sent to the Stormcloaks.
- If Dawnstar is attacked now, it is helpless. The old stone walls are gone for decades.
- This town seems to be under a spell. One that only affects the residents. (before Waking Nightmare)
- The people here are troubled by nightmares. I thought it was me being a vampire that I was not affected. (before Waking Nightmare)
- This tale of recurring nightmares is a bad sign. (before Waking Nightmare)
- Erandur is doing his best to calm the people. (before Waking Nightmare)
- A good thing we thwarted Vaermina's vile plans. (after Waking Nightmare)
- The citizens of Dawnstar can sleep without fear now. (after Waking Nightmare)
- The sense of dread is gone from this town. (after Waking Nightmare)
- Erandur is a good man. Dawnstar can be proud to have him. (after Waking Nightmare, Erandur alive)
- Erandur paid a high price, but he was a good man. (after Waking Nightmare, Erandur dead)
- At least the people of Dawnstar can sleep again. I hope your nights will be troubled by nightmares forever. (after Waking Nightmare, player took Skull of Corruption)
