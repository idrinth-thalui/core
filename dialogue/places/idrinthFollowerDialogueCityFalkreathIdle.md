- This city's jarl is way too weak to rule. I hope he grows a backbone.
- I like the forest, it'll be good hunting here.
- This city was considered part of Cyrodiil for a long time.
- I hope you are not picking a grave for us on the heroes' graveyard.
- Too many graves...and so many of them fresh.
- I guess everyone living here develops a gloomy humour.
