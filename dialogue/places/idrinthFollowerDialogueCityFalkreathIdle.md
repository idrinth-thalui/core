- This city's Jarl is way too weak to rule. I hope he grows a backbone.
- I like the forest, it'll be good hunting here.
- This city was considered part of Cyrodiil for a long time.
- I hope you are not picking a grave for us on the heroes' graveyard.
- Too many graves...and so many of them fresh.
- I guess everyone living here develops a gloomy humour.
- The city's priest of Arkay is an old Altmer - not sure what to think of him.
- Runil, the local priest, always watched me closely whenever I came by.
- The local priest reminds me of a Thalmor battlemage who was in Sentinel during the Night of Green Fire...
- I doubt I'd be welcome here if they found out what I am.
- The general store's owner is a former Stormcloak. Was an interesting experience buying supplies from him. Once.
- Solaf is the nicer of both brothers despite being a former Stormcloak.
- The former Jarl honours the old ways of the Nords. He even bears them in his title of honour.
- I fear the only ones liking me here are the innkeeper and the alchemist.
- There are always dark powers trying to use the dead resting here for their evil schemes.
- Nenya was already helping the steward of Dengeir's predecessor. It is basically her who governs Falkreath for more than 50 years.
- Nenya is a sensible steward, always keeping the best for the citizens in mind.
- Good thing Nenya is keeping Siddgeir's eccentrics at bay.
- Nenya actually helped several times in defeating necromancers careless enough to rise the dead here in the graveyard.
- Nenya is a good example how well Nords and Altmer can work together.
- Runil is a brave man. If the Thalmor ever find out where he is, he will be courtmartialed for desertion. (after retrieving Runil's Journal)
- I knew I had seen Runil before. A man with many regrets. May the Ancestors grant him the peace of mind he strives for. (after retrieving Runil's Journal)
- He took a fitting role to condone for his sins. The graveyard is in good care with him as priest of Arkay. (after retrieving Runil's Journal)
- Falkreath's woods are rich hunting grounds. Just be careful you're not the one being hunted.
- Falkreath and Bruma are very similar.
- A good place to sell off any pelts you gathered.
- The smell of misty woods is refreshing.
