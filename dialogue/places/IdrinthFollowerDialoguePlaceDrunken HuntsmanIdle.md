- So far I have heard Elrindir telling five different versions of the hunting incident. He changes the tale every year.
- Good thing they do not serve many Bosmer drinks here. Most are based on meat. No, not the honey wine one.
- Anoriath is one of the best hunters in Whiterun. Do try any special game dishes they serve.
- They serve many dishes contradicting the Green Pact, you do not have to rely solely on meat and fish.
- Mushroom-stuffed venison sure is a treat.
- If they offer Jagga - it is made from fermented pig's milk. Takes a strong stomach to be a milk drinker in Valenwood.
- I once tried Sun's Dusk ale. Then I heard how it was made... well, it does suit a vampire. But not this one.
- I am glad they do not make bloodfroth. Who mixes blood with egg yolks and tallow?
- When they offer jugged venison, do try it. It is delicious.
- In the winter Elrindir sometimes offers a whole wild boar, slow roasted.
- They do have the best mammoth steaks in Skyrim. When it's available.
- Nothing against cows, but a good side of venison, marinated in red wine...reminds me of home.
- When it comes to cook or roast meat, ask a Bosmer. Just don't ask for their drinks...
