- If you're not blood kin, you're not welcome. Was different when many Orsimer still followed Trinimac.
- Some so-called scholars claim Orsimer are a breed of goblins. The same ones that claim Falmer are ice goblins, too. Guess I'm a gold goblin, then.
- Orsimer society sounds harsh to females, but without strong women a stronghold is lost.
- Despite all wars they'd been trough, they preserved their way of living.
- Many humans think Orsimer are primitive. Well, humans didn't always live a safe life in great cities.
- They seem harsh, but they keep their word.
- They are my brethren by blood. Even if many Altmer do not want to hear that.
- Why do you think they are called Orsimer?
- Do not call them goblin-kin within earshot. It's a grave insult.
- The Pariah Folk chose this name themselves. They are good at keeping grudges.
- Most Orsimer you meet have never seen a real stronghold.
