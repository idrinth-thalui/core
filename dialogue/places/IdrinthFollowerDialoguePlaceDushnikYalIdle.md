- One of the oldest strongholds still existing. I remember it from the second age.
- The former stronghold was dragged into Molag Bal's Village of the Lost. Poor souls, all of them.
- I remember a priest of Trinimac hailing from here. Or rather, the former village.
- A pity I'm not welcome here like in older times. Trinimac and Malacath are two sides of one being.
- They are especially good at fighting, due to the Forsworn around here.
- Despite their inborn wrath, they still follow the ancient warrior codes of Trinimac. Though they won't like to admit it.
- I wonder from time to time if any Orsimer I met stems from one of my lost family members?
- If you are able to become blood-kin, they will defend you as one of their own.
- *Sigh* Don't they realize I AM their kin by both blood and faith?
- Met their hunters while chasing down a rogue vampire. They sell their game off to Markarth.
- They have their own orichalcum mine. Important for any stronghold.
- Noone knows whether the old stronghold was released from Oblivion or they just rebuilt it.
