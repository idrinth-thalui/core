- Last inn ere climbing the fabled 7.000 steps. Far less pilgrims now, though.
- Ivarstead was saved by the Vestige from an evil necromancer. By Trinimac, ever heard of a good necromancer?
- This village reminds me of a cottage in the woods of Auridon, back when... *sigh*
- I remember the village being larger. War has taken it's toll.
- Most people coming here are hunters. Pilgrims are rare nowadays.
- From what I can see, the legendary steps could use a rebuild.
- Haven't seen a frostheart blossom in some time. The last I found was before the Oblivion Crisis.
- Every time I come here, it seems more people have abandoned this village.
- This once was a thriving little village. And it had three inns to fit all the pilgrims.
- It still is a good place to rest from your travels.
- A pity most young folk want to move to Riften. This village is much safer.
- After you being named Dragonborn, I expect more pilgrims coming to High Hrothgar again.
- I do hope this village will be alive with pilgrims again.
- A peaceful place to rest, and the woods are ripe with game to hunt and ingredients to gather.
- Just imagine the trees being abloom with lavender flowers, and you know how my aunt's  wisteria lodge near Auridon looked.
- In the morning sun Ivarstead reminds me of the villages of the Isles.
- Would you leave for the Town of Thieves if you live here?
