And there she is, haunting us again... Mara's heart save us, that IS an ancient Chimer wedding dress! I heard about this kind of apparitions. I hope she's after you.
I will NOT go down that line, no matter what. NO way I'll betray my Arlinve with THAT! I rather die right here... Be calm, Idrinth. She's not after you.
