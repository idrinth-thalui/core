## Refreshed

- The world looks nice through a fresh pair of eyes!
- You look completely awake. I guess you slept well.

## Drained

- Would you want to take a nap?
- I tire a bit, but it's not too bad yet.

## Tired

- I could use a break, my concentration is suffering!
- Your magic skill will suffer if you don't sleep enough...

## Weary

- Next chance we get, we should sleep.
- You are severely limited from your lack of sleep, find a bed!

## Debilitated

- I can't heal you from lack of sleep, you know?
- I'm worried you may fall asleep while walking any time now...
