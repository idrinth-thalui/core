## Refresed

- You look completely awake. I guess you slept well.

## Drained

- Would you want to take a nap?

## Tired

- Your magic skill will suffer if you don't sleep enough...

## Weary

- You are severely limited from your lack of sleep, find a bed!

## Debilitated

- I'm worried you may fall asleep while walking any time now...
