## Warm

- Ah, nice and cosy!
- Perfect, as warm as near a fireplace.

## Comfortable

- A bit cool for my taste...
- It's quiet comfortable right now, just hope it won't get colder.

## Chilly

- This is as cold as the way Nords like their met.
- As cold as a vampire's heart...

## Very Cold

- You look under dressed for the weather here...
- As cold as a Thalmor...

## Freezing

- Let's find something warm, I don't want to carry you to safety.
- Around here we should wear warmer clothes.

## Numb

- I wonder if predators here eat us frozen as well...
- I wonder if I'll be an ice wraith soon...
