# Your healing arts...

- It's always a pleasure to help others in need. I feel like Restoration magic has brought some of my better aspects to light.
- I have done so much harm in my life, I had to learn how to repair it. It is not only a pleasant skill to master, it is also a skill that makes me feel closer to Trinimac.
- I did a lot of damage to other's lives early in my existence. I started learning Restoration magic to balance those dark years out. It gives back some light in my and other's lives.
