# Your healing arts...
- It's always a pleasure to help others in need. I feel like Restoration magic has brought some of my better aspects to light.
- I did a lot of damage to other's lives early in my existance. I started learning Restoration magic to balance those dark years out. It gives back some light in my and other's lives.
