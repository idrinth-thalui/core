# About your swordsmanship...
- I've learned from many masters over the years, while trying to master the art myself.
- When I first learned fighting, it was purely ceremonial with greatsowrds. After I started to actually fight, I prefered shorter weapons and a stealthy approach. I've left that life behind me for a long time and returned to greatswords.
