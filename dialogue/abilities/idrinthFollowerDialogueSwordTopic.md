# About your swordsmanship...

- I've learned from many masters over the years, while trying to master the art myself.
- When I first learned fighting, it was purely ceremonial sparring with greatswords. After I started to genuinely fight, I preferred shorter weapons and a stealthy approach. I've left that life behind me for a long time and returned to greatswords. They are the true weapon of a paladin, just like my patron god Trinimac wielded one as the Champion of Auri-El.
- I was not always a fighter. When I was younger, I tried to be a scholar. My life changed drastically after leaving the Isles, forcing me to learn to wield dagger and blade. When I left that life behing, I returned to the greatsword I first learned to fight with. My roots so to speak. That Trinimac also wields a greatsword only enouraged me to learn more about it.
