- A fine day, with lots of clouds.
- This is what I call nice weather.
- The wind feels refreshing.
- It's a bit too sunny for my taste.
- Xarxes' backside, it's hot!
- We should rename the land to "Sunrim"...
- I like a bit of rain.
- Starting to get wet...
- Well, better lots of rain than lots of sun.
- I'm an Altmer, not a Maormer. I don't like being completely soaked.
- Kyne is wrathful today.
- What a storm!
- Is there a Thu'um to end this storm?
- We should get out of this storm.
- Hey, it's snowing!
- It's snowing. Again.
- We could walk past an entire Falmer army and won't see them...
- I can barely see my hand in front of my eyes.
- I'm not a Snow Elf...
- Any longer in this snowstorm and I turn into an icicle.
