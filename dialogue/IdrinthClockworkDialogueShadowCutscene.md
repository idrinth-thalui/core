What was that sound? Warhorns? Dragons screaming? Never heard anything like this - oh, and we've got company behind us. Apparently dying to meet us.
But seriously, this apparition is different from anything I've ever encountered. Can't touch it, can't hurt it, can't speak with it.
Like some sort of vengeful spirit, yet...different.
