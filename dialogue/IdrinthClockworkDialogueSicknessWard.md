The sickness ward... it looks more like the crossing between a chaotic armoury and a necromancer's playground. Horrible sight. No wonder the Gilded are completely mad.
I would be, too. Trapped in a soul gem inside your own skeleton, encased in dwemer armour put on you while you died...how could any soul find peace after that?
