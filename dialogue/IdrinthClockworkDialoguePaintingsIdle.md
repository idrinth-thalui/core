 - Quite impressive.
 - I vaguely remember seeing that in High Rock.
 - Not quite like Altmer painters, but... pleasing to the eye.
 - Interesting choice.
 - Not what I would put here...
 - Striving harmony with each brush stroke. Commendable.
 - I remember a moment like this...
 - I saw that somewhere else before.
 - This painter? Must have costed a fortune.
 - I like the colour composition.
 - That one is a rework of an Altmer painting.
 - Hey! My parents had a similar painting! From another painter, of course. More talented.
 - That one is clearly a fake, you can see it by the way the brush was placed... What? Surprised I know other things than fighting?
