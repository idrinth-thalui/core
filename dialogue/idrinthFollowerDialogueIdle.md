- *sings a bit of a song*
- How can I trust in you if you keep breaking laws?
- You wouldn't be willing to teach me shouting, would you?
- I miss the deserts of your home, they let the mind wander.
- Any idea how the rebuilding after the war is progressing?
- Did Valenwood change a lot in the last, let's say fifty years?
- Did Elsweyr change a lot in the last, let's say hundred years?
- I always liked to see the sky, it made me think of freedom.
- Food for thought: We are all just a dream.
- If mer and men wouldn't always fight, we would progress much faster.
- Some more cruelty, some more ignorance, it never changes.
- I wonder if the world was easier to handle if you were insane?
- I don't trust those beasts!
- I guess I'll have to run.
- Do you think I should let my beard open? Or is bound like now better?
- You are quite close to the best weapon choice!
- I see we share a favourite weapon.
- Well, time flies by.
- Do we really have time to stand around?
- Are you sure you want to fight with this?
- Let's show them what two hands can do!
- Want to grab a drink when we're done?
- I think we should drop by a merchant soon.
- This intrigues me, we should spend some time here.
- I thirst.
- I need some fresh blood, could we hunt?
- I could really use a good fight right now.
- My blade thirsts.
- Could we kill someone? I have an urge to.
- You look pretty hurt, do you need a health potion?
- You look pretty exhausted, do you need a stamina potion?
- You look pretty drained, do you need a magicka potion?
- You look pretty tired, we should get some rest.
- A cursed sword, eh?
- A hidden blade of cursed origin, how fitting.
- Warhammers are powerful, but do you really need the daedra?
- Unholy maces are not a good choice.
- Shooting with daedric power is not a good idea.
- A daedric axe is not something I feel comfortable having near me.
- That blade is a shame to even own.
- I disapprove of your choice of mask.
- I hope you don't plan on dominating me!
- You are crazy to even touch that staff.
- Showing your allegiance to the great hunter? Not sure if your soul is still yours.
- Not sure if a real hunter needs that hide.
- Not really a good idea to use this specific staff, is it?
- You should be ashamed of wearing Boethia's armour!
- I wouldn't carry anything of Mephala around if I were you!
- Your taste is disgraceful, get rid of that ring!
- Can't say I feel safe around Dawnbreaker.
- You are carrying a horrible soul gem with you.
- I can't be too negative about that hammer, but you shouldn't trust Malacath.
- Protected by Peryite? I hope you can trust in that.
- I can feel it's corrupting influence from here. Get rid of it!
- A dangerous lockpick you have!
- A dangerous book you have!
- A pretty nice soul gem, I hope you didn't treat your soul for it.
- Do we really have nothing better to do than wait?
- Necks have a special kind of attraction, haven't they?
- Have you ever seen the Lunar Forge? It's close to Whiterun.
- It's nice to fight with others again!
- It's nice to travel with a friend!
- I'm happy today, must be our friendship.
- Would you like to talk later?
- I would love to know more about you!
- Sometimes I wonder why people use horses. They are loud, they smell and need to be fed!
- Do you like the music of the bards in Skyrim?
- I could use some time to gather herbs, I need to brew more potions!
- I'm not sure why I'm following a disappointment like you!
- I wish we could slaughter some daedra now!
- You disappoint me!
- You did well!
- I wonder how the world would have been without the Oblivion Crisis...better maybe?
- If the ancient Nord and Falmer wouldn't have clashed, we might have had a long peace...
- Wisps are harmless if left alone. Poor innocent souls...
- Farmers offer painted cows to the giants of Skyrim to live in peace with them.
- Most mammouths and giants don't attack if you sheate your weapons and walk slowly around them.
- Wispmothers are the remnants of Snow Elven women who tried to save their children and themselves from the Atmorans by magic rituals. They did not succeed.
- Slaughterfish are a nuisance. They even follow you on land.
- Most rocks near rivers and ponds are mudcrabs.
- Isn't the sky beautiful today?
- You can get droops from ash hoppers.
- If you stumble upon a small pond, check for fish in it. Or hunt the dragonflies.
- You find the most honey in the Rift - and the most bears.
- You can see the Red Mountain from Solstheim.
- Atmora was once home of Auri-El - Altmora, the Elder Wood.
- Sometimes I wonder how many Snow Elven skeletons are buried in the walls of Windhelm. Then again, I don't want to know...
