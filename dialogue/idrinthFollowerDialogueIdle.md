- *sings a bit of a song*
- *sings a bit of a song*
- How can I trust in you if you keep breaking laws?
- You wouldn't be willing to teach me shouting, would you?
- I miss the deserts of your home, they let the mind wander.
- Any idea how the rebuilding after the war is progressing?
- Did Valenwood change a lot in the last, let's say fifty years?
- Did Elsweyr change a lot in the last, let's say hundred years?
- I always liked to see the sky, it made me think of freedom.
- Food for thought: We are all just a dream.
- If mer and men wouldn't always fight, we would progress much faster.
- Some more cruelty, some more ignorance, it never changes.
- I wonder if the world was easier to handle if you were insane?
- I don't trust those beasts!
- I guess I'll have to run.
- Do you think I should let my beard open? Or is bound like now better?
- You are quite close to the best weapon choice!
- I see we share a favourite weapon.
- Well, time flies by.
- Do we really have time to stand around?
- Are you sure you want to fight with this?
- Let's show them what two hands can do!
- Want to grab a drink when we're done?
- I think we should drop by a merchant soon.
- This intrigues me, we should spend some time here.
- I thirst.
- I need some fresh blood, could we hunt?
- I could really use a good fight right now.
- My blade thirsts.
- Could we kill someone? I have an urge to.
- You look pretty hurt, do you need a health potion?
- You look pretty exhausted, do you need a stamina potion?
- You look pretty drained, do you need a magicka potion?
- You look pretty tired, we should get some rest.
- A cursed sword, eh?
- A hidden blade of cursed origin, how fitting.
- Warhammers are powerful, but do you really need the daedra?
- Unholy maces are not a good choice.
- Shooting with daedric power is not a good idea.
- A daedric axe is not something I feel comfortable having near me.
- That blade is a shame to even own.
- I disapprove of your choice of mask.
- I hope you don't plan on dominating me!
- You are crazy to even touch that staff.
- Showing your allegiance to the great hunter? Not sure if your soul is still yours.
- Not sure if a real hunter needs that hide.
- Not really a good idea to use this specific staff, is it?
- You should be ashamed of wearing Boethia's armour!
- I wouldn't carry anything of Mephala around if I were you!
- Your taste is disgraceful, get rid of that ring!
- Can't say I feel safe around Dawnbreaker.
- You are carrying a horrible soul gem with you.
- I can't be too negative about that hammer, but you shouldn't trust Malacath.
- Protected by Peryite? I hope you can trust in that.
- I can feel it's corrupting influence from here. Get rid of it!
- A dangerous lockpick you have!
- A dangerous book you have!
- A pretty nice soul gem, I hope you didn't treat your soul for it.
- Do we really have nothing better to do than wait?
- Necks have a special kind of attraction, haven't they?
- Have you ever seen the Lunar Forge? It's close to Whiterun.
- It's nice to fight with others again!
- It's nice to travel with a friend!
- I'm happy today, must be our friendship.
- Would you like to talk later?
- I would love to know more about you!
- Sometimes I wonder why people use horses. They are loud, they smell and need to be fed!
- Do you like the music of the bards in Skyrim?
- I could use some time to gather herbs, I need to brew more potions!
- I'm not sure why I'm following a disappointment like you!
- I wish we could slaughter some daedra now!
- You disappoint me!
- You did well!
- I wonder how the world would have been without the Oblivion Crisis...better maybe?
- If the ancient Nord and Falmer wouldn't have clashed, we might have had a long peace...
- Wisps are harmless if left alone. Poor innocent souls...
- Farmers offer painted cows to the giants of Skyrim to live in peace with them.
- Most mammoths and giants don't attack if you sheath your weapons and walk slowly around them.
- Wispmothers are the remnants of Snow Elven women who tried to save their children and themselves from the Atmorans by magic rituals. They did not succeed.
- Slaughterfish are a nuisance. They even follow you on land.
- Most rocks near rivers and ponds are mudcrabs.
- Isn't the sky beautiful today?
- You can get droops from ash hoppers.
- If you stumble upon a small pond, check for fish in it. Or hunt the dragonflies.
- You find the most honey in the Rift - and the most bears.
- You can see the Red Mountain from Solstheim.
- Atmora was once home of Auri-El - Altmora, the Elder Wood.
- Sometimes I wonder how many Snow Elven skeletons are buried in the walls of Windhelm. Then again, I don't want to know...
- I'd prefer you not hunting deer if you're not hungry.
- Rabbits! They're everywhere! Where do they all come from?
- Dunmer rather eat a horse than ride it.
- Be careful around chicken. I killed one once by accident. Guards went after me as if I just assassinated the Emperor.
- Foxes are kind, they'll show you interesting locations.
- Good to have you fighting at my side.
- I'd rather walk behind you, can't trust your aim.
- Met a conjurer once. tried to get too close to his flame atronach. Got burned.
- Some flame atronachs act like ladies of the night. Daedra! All crazy!
- Frost atronachs - animated walking ice brains.
- Ever been attacked by a walking ice wall?
- Storm atronachs - no nice enemies for mages.
- Never trust the daedra.
- I wish I could have seen the cities of old Mereth.
- This land is old. And full of memories. Most of them full of grief.
- I wonder what Ysgramor would say to the Divines of today. Kyne he'd recognise, but Tsun and Stuhn?
- The Trinimac priests of old were not as nice to humans as I am. But honour should always overcome anger.
- Mudcrab meat is very tasty.
- Slaughterfish make better trophies than meals.
- If you hunt for salmon, look out for salmon roe.
- Deer are great game. Just be careful around some guards when hunting.
- Do not pick just the best parts of your prey. A good hunter salvages as much as possible.
- Rabbits are quick, but more than enough for a hearty meal.
- I do hope you are not going to eat a fox?
- Since the Civil War started, stray dogs are a common sight. Poor dogs.
- Be careful, some dogs might be rabid.
- Wolves are multiplying with less guards protecting the roads.
- Some wolves carry more diseases as a skeever.
- I hope that howl came from a large wolf, and not a werewolf.
- Skeever are not to be trifled with. Some are carrying harrowing diseases.
- Skeever may be easy to kill when alone. But they are rarely alone.
- Skeever blood tastes awful. Don't ask.
- Werewolves are on the rise again. I wonder if another of Hircine's hunts is near?
- Some werewolves can control themselves. Most are rabid beasts, though.
- With the Civil War raging, necromancers have an abundance of unclaimed corpses. Filthy thrice-cursed!
- So many orphans left to fend for themselves. I wish I could do more to help them.
- Stars above, I wish the Vigilants would refrain on hunting real dangers instead of me.
- I understand the fervour of the first Vigilants, shortly after the Oblivion Crisis. But these children do not know what they are talking about.
- Vigilants... hunting the vampire who hunts down other vampires. Stendarr have mercy with them...
- Trinimac, another Vigilant?
- Wait - did you hear that?
- There's a strange feel to the air.
- Hm? I apologise, I was lost in thought.
- Arlinve, I wish you could see this...
- That smell...what does that remind me of?
- You noticed that stench, too?
- Bears are unpredictable. They may just try to scare you away, or attack you like a Thalmor bears down on a Talos priest.
- How many sweetrolls do you carry around? No wonder bears are after us.
- If you kill a bear, make sure to leave the pelt intact. They fetch a good price.
- Look around - bears are often near bee hives.
- Bears like berries. Let's pick them.
- Fancy searching for mushrooms today?
- I hope the weather won't change.
- Picking flowers can be quite lucrative.
- Gathering ingredients is a good plan.
- Care for a rest?
- Do tell if you need to rest.
- You know I could walk on all night, but what about you?
- A good day for a brisk walk.
- Sabre cats are fierce predators.
- A sabre cat makes a fine trophy.
- Does it smell like troll here?
- Children stories tell of trolls hiding under bridges and taxing all who want to cross it.
- I have seen troll dolls. Clearly made by someone who never encountered a troll.
- If a frost troll keeps quiet, you're in for an unpleasant surprise in the snow.
- When hunting trolls, keep fire ready. Stock up on torches.
- Troll trophies are an impressive sight. But make sure to wash the pelt. Several times.
- This land was once called Mereth - the Land of Elves.
- I wonder what happened to all the Snow Elven treasures the Atmorans plundered. Did they melt them down and remade them to their liking?
- Some tales tell of the souls of cursed Snow Elves wandering forever in the frozen wastelands.
- How many Nords have mistaken Falmer for a kind of goblin?
- The Nords should be grateful that the Snow Elves do not walk around like their draugr. Skyrim would be full of undead mer.
- The draugr are getting more restless. I rarely saw one outside their tomb a decade ago.
- I wonder how many tales of lurking draugr sprang from Falmer prowling around reclusive homes?
- Such a fine night...Trinimac, with our luck there's a group of draugr waiting around the next corner.
- What is more beautiful? The sunset or the moons lighting up the night sky?
- Have you seen that butterfly? Was that a Green Slipper-Tail?
- Quite a lot of butterflies here. I do hope they are only searching for nectar.
- Do you know that Argonians consider butterflies a delicacy?
- Horker may be slow on ground, but deadly in the water.
- Horker are very useful prey, especially in winter.
- With any luck, we find some bandits waiting for unwary travellers.
- I prefer bandits attacking me. Other wanderers on the road are not as good defending themselves.
- A bandit desperate enough to attack us has made his last mistake. Or hers.
- Ancestors, do let the next bard not sing Ragnar the Red.
- Do you prefer camping in the open or a bed in a cosy inn?
- Want to know more about Skyrim's history? Ask away.
- If we ever tell stories around the campfire, pray do not tell any about Argonians in maid outfits.
- Ah, praise the warmth of Magnus' rays!
