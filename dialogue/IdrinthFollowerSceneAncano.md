## Scene 1 (Inquisition)

A: You! What is the meaning of this?

I: Were you talking to me?

A: Of course, vampire. I assure you that I shall be watching you, very closely.

I: I think you are talking to the wrong person, Thalmor.

A: Do not insult my intelligence. What is it that you want here?

I: Why do you ask? And why should it matter to you?

A: I'm the one asking the questions.

I: I'm the one deciding whether I answer.

A: Allow me to clarify the situation: It is my job to know things. My role here is adviser to the Arch-Mage and aided by knowing everything that transpires here.

I: If the Arch-mage wants to know why I'm here, he can ask me himself. No need to send his Thalmor spy.

A. Preposterous! I suggest that you not further spread this rumour, filthy vampire!
