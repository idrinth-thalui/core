- Your father's court is quite special in how long it survived.
- Can't say I like your father, I'm glad you are less like him, Serana.
- A daughter of Coldharbour, eh, has been a while since I met one. I'm sorry you had to go through that.
- You missed a lot while you were hidden away, the Oblivion Crisis alone was interesting already.
- Not sure if it's a good idea to be that public about vampirism, Serana.
- You are followed by a vampire princess and a vampire paladin, sounds like a story.
