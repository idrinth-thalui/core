# Can I ask you something?

- I'm not sure you are even able to.
- Alright, bother me!
- Why don't you ask someone else?
- I guess I'll answer this once.
- Well, why not?
- I won't stop you...
- What do you want to know now?
- Go ahead, be nosy!
- You need to know everything, don't you?
- Sure, go right ahead.
