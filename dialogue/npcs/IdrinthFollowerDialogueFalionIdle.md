- Falion is said to be a conjurer. He'd better know what he's doing.
- Many an aspiring mage thought he can bent the forces of Oblivion to his will. I fear he'll be too ambitious.
- At least he takes good care of the girl, Agni. Though teaching her in his school of magig - I don't like it.
- He's very interested in vampires.
- His sister loves him dearly. May her faith in him not be tested.
- Seen him once in the swamps, taking down a roaming chaurus.
- I'd rather not talk to him. He's too interested in me.
