- Mikael is clearly more of a Breton bard. Nord skalds have a different attitude about their ballads.
- He's always trying to please the ladies. It gets annoying sometimes.
- His voice is quite nice. Though he sings "Ragnar the Red" way too often for my taste.
- He once mistook a travelling Dunmer merchant for a woman. Ah, sweet memories...*chuckle*
- There are worse bards in Skyrim.
- Be careful, or you find yourself the center of his attention. He always has an eye for the ladies.
- Don't look, but he's trying to flirt with you. Again. 
- Shall I talk to him? He clearly won't stop bothering you tonight, my friend.
