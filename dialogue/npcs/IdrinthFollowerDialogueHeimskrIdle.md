- Talos, let him loose his voice...please!
- Trinimac, gift me the power to ignore him...
- I need some mead...
- I need some wine...
- You know, Heimskr's sermons are actually enjoyable. After a whole casket of Colovian brandy.
- Trinimac, grant me patience...
- Talos, please finally answer him!
- Could we please leave?
- Any chance we could shut Heimskr up?
- Now would be a perfect time for an Oblivion gate opening - though I fear the daedra hear him and turn to flee...
- How do the Companions stand the constant preaching?
- No wonder the Companions drink so much mead, being so close to Heimskr.
