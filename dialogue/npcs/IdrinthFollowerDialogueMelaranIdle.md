- Melaran is Thane Erikur's personal wizard. Doesn't surprise me.
- I'm not sure whether he's just a greedy little wizard or a Thalmor spy.
- He's always very interested in new faces at court. Though he plays to be bored.
- Now that he's promoted to court wizard, I hope my suspicions aren't true.
- If he's a Thalmor spy, the Solitude court has a big problem.
- From personal wizard to Thane - I wonder if he took over Erikur's wealth, too. 
- Erikur's business in the hands of a Thalmor - a frightening thought.
