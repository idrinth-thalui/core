      "idrinthFollowerDialogueAlterationTopic.md": "# Your skill in alteration magic...\r\n\r\n- Alteration is mostly a pastime for me, although it's one I've practised for a long time.\r\n- Alteration is more of a secondary skill for me. I mostly focus on improving my defences.\r\n",
      "idrinthFollowerDialogueBatsTopic.md": "# How do you turn into bats?\r\n\r\n- It's a combination of summoning bats and turning yourself into one.\r\n- Well, I'm a vampire. It's an ability which was...gifted to me.\r\n- Some things come natural to me. Bats have a liking to me I can easily use.\r\n",
      "idrinthFollowerDialogueHealingTopic.md": "# Your healing arts...\r\n\r\n- It's always a pleasure to help others in need. I feel like Restoration magic has brought some of my better aspects to light.\r\n- I have done so much harm in my life, I had to learn how to repair it. It is not only a pleasant skill to master, it is also a skill that makes me feel closer to Trinimac.\r\n- I did a lot of damage to other's lives early in my existence. I started learning Restoration magic to balance those dark years out. It gives back some light in my and other's lives.\r\n",
      "idrinthFollowerDialogueSwordTopic.md": "# About your swordsmanship...\r\n\r\n- I've learned from many masters over the years, while trying to master the art myself.\r\n- When I first learned fighting, it was purely ceremonial sparring with greatswords. After I started to genuinely fight, I preferred shorter weapons and a stealthy approach. I've left that life behind me for a long time and returned to greatswords. They are the true weapon of a paladin, just like my patron god Trinimac wielded one as the Champion of Auri-El.\r\n- I was not always a fighter. When I was younger, I tried to be a scholar. My life changed drastically after leaving the Isles, forcing me to learn to wield dagger and blade. When I left that life behind, I returned to the greatsword I first learned to fight with. My roots so to speak. That Trinimac also wields a greatsword only encouraged me to learn more about it.\r\n",
      "idrinthFollowerDialogueWolvesTopic.md": "# How do you call wolves?\r\n\r\n- I think it has to do with my blood, but I also spend a lot of time training them.\r\n- I spend a lot of time practising and feeding them. A little food goes a long way.\r\n"

    "about": {
      "idrinthFollowerDialogueBloodSuckerTopic.md": "# How did you become a vampire?\r\n\r\n- I was infected by a disease and died from it, before being reborn stronger and faster.\r\n- It was actually on my first trip to Tamriel from the Summerset Isles.\r\n- I didn't go looking for it, that's certain.\r\n- A Daughter of Coldharbour took a liking to me and decided to turn me.\r\n- I was turned when I was still young, barely an adult yet.\r\n- I was turned in a court not dissimilar to the one of Lord Harkon.\r\n- While I was turned against my will, the change at first overwhelmed me and I lived as a monster. It took long years to recover from both the monster as well as the cage I was in.\r\n",
      "idrinthFollowerDialogueCivilWarOpinionTopic.md": "# What's your opinion on the current civil war?\r\n\r\n- I'm happy we managed to free those prisoners from the fort.\r\n- Good thing, that we got the faked courier's orders into enemy hands.\r\n- A good thing we captured the enemy's weapon shipment, isn't it?\r\n- I'm glad you decided for a side, let's bring them victory!\r\n- The Imperials have a point in trying to stay united and strong.\r\n- The Stormcloaks have a point in wanting to pray to Talos and having a strong leader.\r\n- The Thalmor are the only ones benefiting from this continuing war.\r\n",
      "idrinthFollowerDialogueFamilyTopic.md": "# What about your family?\r\n\r\n- I don't have the best relationship with my blood family. We disapprove of each other's god.\r\n- My blood mother, a Nord, had a thing for mer. A lot of my brothers and sisters are mer.\r\n- My blood family has spread through all of Tamriel, it's not unlikely we will meet one of those Molag Bal worshippers.\r\n- My family doesn't share my last name, since that is more of a title given to me.\r\n- There is no family in Skyrim right now as far as I know.\r\n- My former wife and I split after a few years, but stayed in contact.\r\n- My sister may be long dead, but she had children. Some of her descendants are still alive and well. They sometimes send letters asking for advice and talking about their lives.\r\n- I lost my wife to time, she died of old age, never accepting the blood kiss.\r\n- My former wife was once the centre of my life.\r\n- My father died because he worked too hard, never took enough of a break.\r\n- My mother is dead, she lived a long, fulfilling life.\r\n- I never had children, just never had the chance to get any.\r\n- My love for Chimer cuisine is based on my family. My former wife was a good cook. Now Dunmer cuisine is the closest it gets.\r\n- My brother rose far in military ranks in a short time. He profited a lot from the ones turned to Orsimer leaving.\r\n- My family still exists, but I doubt they want anything to do with me officially. Some are Thalmor, but the leaders at least see me as a black sheep of the family. That is why I won't give out my house name, no reason to endanger them further.\r\n- I'm glad that there seems to be light in my family, hope. They are in a dark place now, but they'll survive, they always have.\r\n- The recent increased interest in my family by the Thalmor worries me. I'm unsure how they made the connection.\r\n",
      "idrinthFollowerDialogueFoodTopic.md": "# What food do you prefer?\r\n\r\n- Saying no to a good soup is hard.\r\n- Many things, even garlic from time to time.\r\n- As you can guess, I mostly live off blood.\r\n- I prefer talking about drinks, how about red wine?\r\n- I prefer fresh meat, in the best case hunted.\r\n- There are few kinds of food I haven't tried, but simple meals are fine by me.\r\n- Give me a hearty Nord stew over a posh Breton 9-course-meal anytime.\r\n- I'm quite fond of Morrowind cuisine.\r\n- A good piece of meat with some seasoning is never a bad choice.\r\n",
      "idrinthFollowerDialogueGreatWarTopic.md": "# What did you do during the Great War?\r\n\r\n- I spend more time waiting for fights than actually fighting.\r\n- I tried to survive, being an Altmer is not easy when they are the enemy.\r\n- I hunted the hunters of the Blades.\r\n- I tried to help the Empire where possible.\r\n- I was fighting the Thalmor, helping resistance movements in conquered territories.\r\n- Some of my actions caused a bit of a stir, after all I look similar to Aldmeri soldiers.\r\n- I started getting hunted then and there. My main hunter had not yet given up when I entered Skyrim.\r\n- That would be a long story. To keep it simple I waited a lot, fought a little and survived.\r\n",
      "idrinthFollowerDialogueHealVampirismTopic.md": "# Do you want to be healed of your vampirism?\r\n\r\n- I have been a vampire for longer than most people live. I'm so used to it's limitations and benefits, it would be strange to exchange them. Additionally we are in a time that needs every bit of power to quickly end the civil war. Only a united and strong Skyrim can keep the Thalmor at bay. I don't have the luxury of leaving the fight before I have to.\r\n- I'm quite happy being who I am. Yes, there have been thoughts about retiring, but there is still too much to experience. Even someone of my age, didn't often have the chance to meet dragons. So I have to decline for now.\r\n-That is a hard question to answer. I have thought a lot about it, when I was just a young vampire. It seemed to me, that at that point, there was just not enough to do. Right now though, we have strong Thalmor, strong Daedra and Dragons to hunt. It's just not the right time to think about a kind of retirement.\r\n",
      "idrinthFollowerDialogueHeroesTopic.md": "# Who is your paragon among the heroes of Tamriel?\r\n\r\n- A recent addition to my paragons is General Tullius. His tactical genius is something to aspire to.\r\n- An addition from the Great War was the Emperor Titus Mede II. He showed a willingness to self-sacrifice for the betterment of others. The Battle of the Red Ring showed this clearly.\r\n- Surprisingly enough, Vivec is actually someone I consider a paragon. His fight for the safety of those he protected was a great task, even for a false god.\r\n- Martin Septim's self-sacrifice to end the Oblivion Crisis was something I consider exemplary. I don't want to die, but his death saved us all.\r\n",
      "idrinthFollowerDialogueMageCollegeTopic.md": "# What do you think about the College of Winterhold?\r\n\r\n- The Eye of Magnus is an interesting artefact. Too bad it has been taken away by the Psijic Order. I can't say I trust them enough to keep it and us safe.\r\n- The Staff of Magnus is an interesting artefact. I never thought the College would ever get something this exiting!\r\n- The Augur seems to be an interesting creature. I'll spend some time here in the future to try and study him. He's way more interesting than most mages of flesh and bone, wouldn't you agree?\r\n- Did you read about the \"Night of Tears\" you got from Fellglow Keep? It's history worth remembering, not worth repeating.\r\n- I'm curious about the secret found under Saarthal. I'm sure there is more to be found given a few centuries worth of study. This object though, it seems familiar, even if I can't place it right now.\r\n- I liked their focus on defence in the first lesson. It is wise to keep yourself alive first and foremost. Personally I prefer armour enhancements over wards tho.\r\n- I doubt their expertise a bit. They seem to lack a sizeable amount of mages that study. On the other hand they are still a useful institution to teach magic to newcomers.\r\n",
      "idrinthFollowerDialogueMagicTopic.md": "# What do you think about magic?\r\n\r\n- Some Nords consider magic unnatural. For all I have experienced, it is part of all of us.\r\n- I wouldn't trust those dealing with brainless undead or daedra, otherwise it's a great help.\r\n- I prefer restoration and alteration, but the other schools have their value as well.\r\n- Besides necromancy and conjuration, I think the risks are manageable.\r\n- I think magic is a powerful tool, like any other it can be abused tho.\r\n- Since the Oblivion Crisis Nords deeply shun all kinds of magic, yet their ancient God of Magic, Jhunal, is revered now as Julianos.\r\n- In the old days of Atmoran rulers, magic was called \"the Clever Craft\". Too many wars with mer made the Nords wary of it.\r\n",
      "idrinthFollowerDialogueSkyrimTopic.md": "# Why are you in Skyrim?\r\n\r\n- This civil war is our best chance for a better future, if the Thalmor don't gain from it.\r\n- It changed, now I want to taste a dragon.\r\n- To see the Dwemer's cities again - it has been a long time.\r\n- To stop the vampire stupidity from harming all of us.\r\n- To stop the Thalmor from destroying everything.\r\n",
      "idrinthFollowerDialogueSummersetTopic.md": "# Can you tell me about the Summerset Isles?\r\n\r\n- The mainland is by far the biggest of the Isles. It houses many big cities and towns in it's rolling hills. The Crystal Tower on it was especially impressive. I wish you could have seen it before it collapsed in the Oblivion Crisis. I think losing Crystal-Like-Law is what lead to the Thalmor's dominance. We Altmer felt like we lost a part of our souls that day. And most of us turned to whatever strength we could find.\r\n- Auridon is the second largest island in the Summerset Isles. It is home to the cities of Firsthold, Skywatch, and Vulkhel Guard.\r\n- Artaeum, one of the isles, is the only one I have never visited. It is home to the Psijic Order, a very powerful organisation.\r\n- My parents took me to visit the Crystal Tower once, when I was a child.... It was filled with light, bright as the sun. When we were on the top, paying our respects to our ancestors, I could see as far as Valenwood....\r\n",
      "idrinthFollowerDialogueThalmorTopic.md": "# Can you tell me more about the Thalmor?\r\n\r\n- They are an interesting and powerful faction. Based on our weaknesses, they force our people into wars that drive us to extinction. Additionally, based on our strengths, they try to destroy all opposition.\r\n- Think of them as the evil in the hearts of the Altmer. They conquer and kill and see no reason to let any none mer live. Also they lack individuality, they drive it out of everyone.\r\n- The Thalmor have been my enemies for as long as I can remember. They desire a return to the past, while I desire a better future for all of us. Worst of all, they will likely kill everyone for their goals.\r\n- The Thalmor are everything evil in us Altmer turned to the extreme. They won't rest until they conquer and control all. And that is the best case, worst case they will kill all non-mer.\r\n- I think of them as an illness, that has infected the Altmer. Insecurity since the Oblivion Crisis and a lack of strong leadership empower them. We all reacted too late to stop them relatively easily and quick. Now they are settled in and will be hard to remove.\r\n- Alas, how far the Thalmor had strayed from their former selves. Under Queen Ayrenn they were the backbone of the Aldmeri Dominion, keeping us Altmer, Bosmer and Khajiit together.\r\n- In the olden days, the Thalmor protected the Isles and the ideals of the Aldmeri Dominion. And they stayed true to these goals. But now...\r\n- The Oblivion Crisis brought out the worst of the Thalmor. What you see is a mockery, nay a distortion of their ancient counterparts.\r\n- It grieves me to see so many bright young Altmer being turned and twisted by the vile new ways of the Thalmor. If only they had lived in the days of yore...\r\n- Once, many Bosmer and Khajiit were amongst the highest ranks of the Thalmor. Hard to imagine in these dark times. Now they are mere servants, if not less...\r\n- The Thalmor claim they uphold the superiority of themselves over all others. Even other Altmer. In the elden days, the Divine Prosecutors would have them imprisoned for heresy.\r\n",
      "idrinthFollowerDialogueThoughtsTopic.md": "# What are you thinking about?\r\n\r\n- The gods, isn't it weird how inactive some of them are?\r\n- Magic, I specialised in restoration, but I'm thinking about learning more.\r\n- Combat, I wonder if I should use more or less magic.\r\n- Werewolves. I wonder how my life would have been if I was one.\r\n- The Dragonborns. I've seen a lot of other powerful beings, but none like them.\r\n- Vampires, how come most are an evil to be rooted out?\r\n- The Aldmeri Dominion, it still surprises me how easily it was rebuilt.\r\n- The Great War, I hope some wounds will heal before the second one.\r\n- My father, he was strict, but well meaning - something we could use right now.\r\n- My Birthplace, somehow those butterflies reminded me of my mother's garden.\r\n- The Thalmor, I know we are racist all in all, but they are extremists even for us.\r\n- Dragons, why are they even trying to conquer and kill?\r\n- Reviving the Blades. Stopping the Thalmor is something they could manage.\r\n- I love the blood of bandits in the morning!\r\n- It's smaller than I thought, but it's still impressive. I've never been here before.\r\n- Dwemer, I'm wondering if they are somewhere in Oblivion.\r\n- Giants, it's sad to see these majestic creatures treated like troublemakers.\r\n- I guess no one dares to attack them, the walls look unmaintained.\r\n- This new capital looks decent, they are hiding their skeletons well.\r\n- This city was once kingly as the name suggests. It really doesn't deserve the title now.\r\n- It's nice to fight side by side with another Altmer again.\r\n- The Falmer, it's sad how this once proud species lost their minds and souls.\r\n- Long ago Falmer were like us Altmer, a proud and noble people. The true kings of the North.\r\n- The Dwemer and Falmer, it is strange how quickly the Falmer turned into beasts after being helped by the Dwemer.\r\n",
      "idrinthFollowerDialogueVampirismTopic.md": "# What do you think about Vampires?\r\n\r\n- The thirst is strong, but you can live with it.\r\n- Like everything else, it's a two-edged blade.\r\n- I like the time it gives a lot.\r\n- As long as you drink from those you kill, it's no harm to anyone.\r\n- Well, it can be a blessing, you know?\r\n",
      "idrinthFollowerDialogueWeaponsTopic.md": "# What weapons are your favourites?\r\n\r\n- Any kind of melee weapon, I like to spill the blood of my enemies.\r\n- Not fangs, I can tell you that. Try getting Khajiit fur out of them!\r\n- I follow Trinimac, so take a wild guess!\r\n- Greatswords are my main weapon - especially elven ones.\r\n- I like greatswords, but I can deal with anything.\r\n",
      "idrinthFollowerDialogueWeddingTopic.md": "# Are you married?\r\n\r\n- Mara hasn't blessed me in a long time.\r\n- Hopefully not!\r\n- Only to my sword now.\r\n- No, I once was.\r\n- Not anymore, it was a long time ago. I still love her though! Would you return the ring?\r\n- I was once married to one of your people. The love of my life.\r\n",
      "idrinthFollowerDialogueWerewolvesTopic.md": "# What do you think about Werewolves?\r\n\r\n- Very fluffy usually, I like running with them in wolf form.\r\n- Formidable fighters, there is a reason my sword is silvered.\r\n- If you keep your hunger at bay, you are a strong bunch.\r\n- Some are beasts, but most are reasonable and good hunters.\r\n- Well, you are not the first one I've met.\r\n",
      "idrinthFollowerDialogueWhoTopic.md": "# Who are you?\r\n\r\n- I'm a lover of wine, women and winning - what did you expect?\r\n- I'm an old warrior, but not yet tired of fighting daedra.\r\n- I'm a hunter of the night, not quite like you.\r\n- I'm a vampire like you, who has enjoyed long travels through Tamriel.\r\n- I'm just an Altmer who has travelled Tamriel for a long time.\r\n- I'm just an ordinary citizen reacting to the world around me.\r\n- I'm an ancient evil, barely kept in check by my faith in Trinimac.\r\n- I'm a servant of Trinimac, the Paladin of Auri-El.\r\n"

I didn't think it would work.\r\n-  At least you know the basics.\r\n-  Not bad.\r\n-  You clearly got better.\r\n-  Now that is something new...\r\n-  You are well versed in alchemy.\r\n-  When you sell those potions, you'll make cood coin.\r\n-  Those potions will surely help us.\r\n-  That is truly a dangerous poison.\r\n-  Can you make more of these fire resistance potions?\r\n-  Excellent work!\r\n",

They could come in handy!\r\n- Your father is a dangerous man, you need to grow up to face him!\r\n- We should spend some time talking about our, no, the Aldmeri's, history!\r\n- You may be the light that is needed for the Altmer to survive.\r\n- I should introduce you to my great-grand-niece, you two may become allies.\r\n- I admit I misjudged you at first, Caryalind.

They are easier to learn and always useful.\r\n- If you want to continue fighting with daggers, we should work on your evasion skills.\r\n- I am always ready to spar with you, Caryalind. I can't let the only good Thallery die of sloppy fighting skills.\r\n- You have a kind heart. A beacon of how we Altmer should strife to be.\r\n- I'd be glad if we can sit down and talk about home. I haven't been to the Isles since the Great Anguish.\r\n- Want to share a bottle of wine and tell me how our home fares? I long to see Alinor again.\r\n- The Ancestors truly smile on you, Caryalind.\r\n- Are all Oblivion Gates destroyed by now?\r\n- Which is your favourite place back home?

Beware, young man, they can be darker than you wish.\r\n- You may not be the best battlemage I've seen, but you have courage. Admirable.\r\n- Do not fret about how you fought the last time. Not everyone faces danger head on with blade swinging.\r\n- Still up to exploring all of Skyrim, young man? Draugr are not easy to face.\r\n- Flavius...a very old family name. Related to the Flavius family of Kvatch back from the time of Reman?\r\n- That, dear Lucien, was a deer. No need to look out for trouble.\r\n- You held your ground well in that fight.\r\n- I suggest more training with an actual weapon. Magicka can always be drained, and then you are powerless.\r\n- Learn more spells, Lucien. It should be easy for a bright lad like you.\r\n- It feels good to see such an innocent soul in these dark times.\r\n- Are you alright, Lucien? That dragon was quite the sight - and quite the challenge.\r\n- I have seem many things in my time - but I never thought dragons would return.\r\n- I can feel your eyes on me. Is there anything I can help you with? Answer your questions?\r\n- The Dwemer were fascinating. I remember them, though I rarely met them.\r\n- Ah, I miss the times when the Snow Elves still roamed this land...I miss the times the Paragons of Trinimac visited the Isles.\r\n- I do not mind to answer any questions you have, Lucien. I have seen more things than you imagine.\r\n- It always grieves my heart when I see those twisted shadows of the once proud Snow Elves...\r\n- Ah, Nords. Still as headstrong as their Atmoran ancestors. I wonder whom of us they fear more?\r\n- The city of Ysgramor. It had seen better times. You should have seen it.\r\n- I wish you'd have seen Winterhold in it's prime. I remember a cosy little inn right on the cliff's edge... all gone now.\r\n- If you ever want to know more about Altmer religion and history, I will gladly answer.\r\n- Do not worry, Lucien.

Most do not.\r\n- Care for some sparring? I can teach you a few moves.\r\n- Venturing into a Dwemer ruin alone - that was brave. And foolish.\r\n- So...Aerin saved you. Quite the tale.\r\n- You wield a fine blade. May it last longer than my glass sword.\r\n- You're very tolerant towards other races. A rare trait for Nords, and a welcomed one.\r\n- If you'd be an Altmer, you would make a fine warrior of Trinimac.\r\n- Aerin seems to be very solicitous around you.\r\n",

I will not.\r\n- I do hope my being an Altmer will not make you hate me?\r\n- Do not worry - bring no harm to me, and I will not harm you.\r\n- Skyrim must look very cold to you.

I'm sorry you had to go through that.\r\n- You missed a lot while you were hidden away, the Oblivion Crisis alone was interesting already.\r\n- Not sure if it's a good idea to be that public about vampirism, Serana.\r\n- You are followed by a vampire princess and a vampire paladin, sounds like a story.\r\n- The sun is shining, let's wait for our princess to complain...\r\n- Nice snowfall, not too heavy. You want to be in a cave now, right, Serana?\r\n- You know, some fresh blood in your veins would do you good, Serana!\r\n- I wonder, how much have you really seen in your unlife?\r\n- You should have a look at Dunmeri drinks, Serana, they have a taste unlike most others!\r\n- I recognise the style of your castle home, has been a while since that was popular...\r\n",

Helped him once to clear out a cliff racer colony pestering the farmfolk.\r\n- Wish you could have seen the old Dwemer cities in their old glory.\r\n- Excellent swordsmanship there, my Dunmer friend.\r\n- By Trinimac, I assure you I'm not one of those filthy bloodsuckers.\r\n- We should share battle stories by a bottle of Sujamma.\r\n- How fares Morrowind after the Red Year? The Red Mountain is still more active than ever before.\r\n- I take it you defended Blacklight during the Argonian Invasion?\r\n- You're worth every septim, my Dunmer friend.\r\n- Whoa, Teldryn, watch where you summon your flame atronach!\r\n- I miss riding silt striders. I heard there is one left on Solstheim?\r\n- I always wanted to ride a guar, but... how does it feel?\r\n- Are you affiliated with House Redoran or a freelancer?\r\n- I take Azura is your patron goddess?

From a woodcutter?\r\n- Be glad Farkas is such a gentle soul. I would train you harder.\r\n- Roaring and flailing your weapon may look intimidating, yet you are no match for a seasoned warrior. Or a fierce beast.\r\n- Care to spar, Torvar? You'll need the training.\r\n- Trinimac's mercy, don't hit your shield-siblings!\r\n",
      "idrinthFollowerDialogueUthgerdIdle.md": "- Ooh, what're you gonna do, beat me to death?\r\n- You may wield a greatsword, but you need training, Uthgerd.\r\n- I'll make sure to keep an eye on you.

I serve the Champion of Auri-El!\r\n- Varrick Veil. I will remember your name. For the day I carve it into your gravestone.\r\n- A magic-using Follower of the Cursed One. Now that's something you don't see every day.\r\n- Pathetic reflexes... that was only a hare running through the bushes.\r\n- Let me guess - your magic prowess lies in Alteration and Alchemy? Silence and poison, just like your cursed Prince.\r\n- Granted, you did look out for others back then. Does not mean I have to like you.\r\n- See to it that your minion doesn't get in the way of my blade.\r\n- Trinimac, the trials you sent me...I will endure them, Champion of Auri-El.\r\n- Don't you dare fighting behind me again, daedra lover. I don't trust you.\r\n- If you have to pray to your beloved Cursed One, do it in silence.\r\n- Do not worry. I will not stoop so low as to smite you in your sleep.\r\n- Eat, rest, sleep. If I claim your head, it will be in fair duel. Such is the way of Trinimac.\r\n- I do trust you not to sully our mutual friend's honour with killing me in my sleep?\r\n- Your view of worship is quite... interesting. Sounds more like a follower of Malacath to me.\r\n- No wonder most Boethiah cultists see you as a blasphemer - you would fit better into an Orsimer Trinimac cult. I know what I'm talking of.\r\n- Never heard about this interpretation of Boethiah before. Maybe we can fight side by side against a mutual enemy.\r\n- If you have to pray, please do it on the other end of the camp. And quietly.\r\n- Vampires. And starved ones. Best we take them out ere they endanger any innocents.\r\n- I smell vampires. Be on your guard, Varrick. They would love to sacrifice you to their Prince.\r\n- Hm - at least we have a common enemy in Molag Bal.\r\n- Guess our common goal to protect our mutual friend here makes us ... frenemies?\r\n- Let us make a truce. I will not attack you for your beliefs, and you will not attack me for mine.\r\n- I will never like you, or your beliefs. But I acknowledge your prowess in battle. And your way of honour.\r\n- Speaking of frostbite - ever seen a Falmer vampire? Now that is a nasty sight... makes you wish you were blind.\r\n- Trinimac preserve me! Your constant jokes are growing on me!\r\n- What did the Molag Bal cultist say to the Trinimac priest? Urrgl... stars above, did I just made a joke?\r\n- First or second watch, Varrick?\r\n- I never thought I would trust a Boethiah cultist. But you've proven your worth, Varrick.\r\n- May Trinimac forgive me for liking you. But there is still good in your heart.\r\n- By my ancestors, if you even dare thinking of betraying our friend's heart, I will hunt you through all realms of Oblivion.\r\n- Please do not corrupt his/her heart, Varrick. He/she has a pure soul.\r\n- I wish you both be happy. Savour your love while you can. It ends too soon too often...\r\n- So, you were a farmer and father once... I am sorry for your loss.\r\n- I understand now why you became the man you are. I, too, know the meaning of loss. I still miss her...\r\n- Varrick, my friend, you are officially the least hated Boethiah cultist of Tamriel. At least where I'm concerned.\r\n- Sometimes I wish I was a father. But the thought of leaving her alone with our child... It was better that way.\r\n- Ah, Varrick, you should have tasted the honey wine of the Snow Elves. I loved the one with lavender and snowberries...\r\n- To the ones we loved and lost. May they find eternal peace.\r\n",
      "idrinthFollowerDialogueVilkasIdle.md": "- If you don't mind, could we spar a bit, Vilkas?\r\n- Good that we aren't enemies, you are capable enough to threaten me.\r\n- You could be a great follower of Trinimac if you were a mer.\r\n- It smells a bit like a wet dog here...\r\n- As a member of the Companions, do you hate all elves?\r\n",

Besides being very powerful, Trinimac is his champion. He promises the mer that they can ascend to the timeless freedom again they lost when the world was made.\r\n",
      "idrinthFollowerDialogueClavicusVileTopic.md": "# Clavicus Vile.\r\n\r\n- For a Daedra he is not so bad. You can't rely on him not harming you, but he keeps his promises. Literally. So mind the exact words of the deal. I would rather make deals with his companion if I had to.\r\n- I'm glad I never made a pact with him. He will find a way to turn your words against you while fulfilling his promise. Fulfilling his promise in the worst possible way for the receiver.\r\n",
      "idrinthFollowerDialogueKynarethTopic.md": "# Kynareth.\r\n\r\n- For me she still is Kyne, the Sister-Hawk. She is a very powerful goddess and controls the skies. She's a representation of the world's nature and it's powers, and her wrath is the raging storm.\r\n- Kynareth is the name she was given as one of the Eight Divines. She was turned from the fierce warrior-wife of Shor to a kind mother watering the crops.\r\n",
      "idrinthFollowerDialogueKyneTopic.md": "# Kyne.\r\n\r\n- Well, Kyne is more a goddess for the Nords than one for me. She certainly gave them a great gift with the voice - one I envy them for. And her storms are certainly impressive, especially here in Skyrim. It is said that rain are the tears Kyne still sheds for her fallen husband.\r\n",
      "idrinthFollowerDialogueLorkhanTopic.md": "# Lorkhan.\r\n\r\n- He is the one bringing us this existence. I'm unsure if I should be thankful or angry about it, since he reduced us. His heart is likely the most interesting artefact that I have ever heard of. It can create new godlike beings and make entire races disappear.\r\n- The god of mankind. He is the one getting the Aedra to create Mundus. In turn it robbed them and us of power. I hope Auri-El's promise of returning to a state of timelessness will at some point come true. It would resolve so many conflicts, if the mer were to return to where we came from.\r\n- As the father of Nirn, he is the one giving us this existence. His heart was taken from him by my angry ancestors. It created the three god Tribunal for the dunmer later on. I'm unsure if his betrayal is a blessing or a curse. I enjoy living in Tamriel on most days.\r\n",
      "idrinthFollowerDialogueMagnusTopic.md": "# Magnus.\r\n\r\n- He is an important god to me. I practice his arts and his good will is not something to scuff at. He is one of the gods that most Altmer should follow, given our talent for magic.\r\n- He turned his back on Nirn after Lorkhan bound the other gods to it's creation, leaving to Aetherius though the hole we now call the sun. Yet still we can feel his power.\r\n",
      "idrinthFollowerDialogueMalacathTopic.md": "# Malacath.\r\n\r\n- He is the form that Trinimac was forced into if you believe the stories. His lust for vengeance is dangerous, but he is rather honourable for a Daedric Prince. I'm sad the Orsimer flocked to him instead of staying true to Trinimac. It could have been a better life for them if they did.\r\n",

Can't say we are better off without her though.\r\n- The Atmorans referred to her as Handmaiden of Kyne, and implied her being one of Shor's concubines. I would not mention that to her priesthood.\r\n- I'm not sure if she blessed or cursed me. I found the love of my life, but lost her. Her power is great, maybe one of the greatest. I think it's just underestimated because it's rather subtle.\r\n",
      "idrinthFollowerDialogueMeridiaTopic.md": "# Meridia.\r\n\r\n- She is an enemy of the undead. But fails to see intelligent undead as something less evil. Can't say I'm a fan of her limited distinction.\r\n",

And obviously there is the daedra issue, I fight them, I don't serve them.\r\n- She is the one bringing the desperate into even deeper trouble.

He is for all intents and purposes a champion of mankind, the equivalent of Trinimac in my mind. That his worship is forbidden is a crime at best. I can understand the anger it causes.\r\n- You are asking a mer about the hero-god of mankind. The one who destroyed our lands and cities with the Numidium. I can understand his followers, but it feels as bad as Daedra worship to me.\r\n- Having seen his war crimes, it makes me uneasy when meeting his followers. Most of them don't seem to be that destructive and rather honourable warriors, but a bit of doubt always remains. It must be as difficult for you, as a human, to work with me.\r\n",
      "idrinthFollowerDialogueTrinimacTopic.md": "# Trinimac.\r\n\r\n- Trinimac is the god I serve. He was betrayed and his corrupted form is followed by the Orsimer. In his original form he is a warrior-champion of mer.\r\n- Trinimac is the champion of mer. He is the one who brought light back into my life after dark years. I've served him faithfully ever since.\r\n- The champion of Auri-El is a difficult god. While he protects elven kind, he hates mankind. At least that is what we are told. For all my years serving him, he never appeared to drive me to slaughter men. I see him as a protector first and foremost.\r\n"

    "idrinthFollowerDialogueGuildCompanionsIdle.md": "- Farkas and Vilkas were the greatest troublemakers in Whiterun as kids. And the ones always ready to help their Elders.\r\n- I found Farkas and Vilkas  far out in the woods once. They took turns riding on my shoulders on the way back.\r\n- Ah, the days when the twins were rallying all other children to hunt me, the \"Evil Snow Elf\"...\r\n- I remember when another kid mocked Farkas for being as stupid as a mudcrab...good thing I was there to keep Vilkas back.\r\n- They always begged me to try out my sword. You should have seen  how proud Farkas was when he could raise it.\r\n- He doesn't like to hear it, but Vilkas always got in trouble. Too smart for his age, that boy.\r\n- Farkas always was gentle, but when he got angry or wanted to defend his brother, he'd fight anything.\r\n- Other kids never stood a chance - the twins were inseparable.\r\n- When I came back after the Great War, Farkas and Vilkas ran straight up to me and wanted to play with me again.\r\n- Once some kid stole Vilkas' book...it took Kodlak, Jergen and me to stop the twins taking revenge.\r\n- I rescued them once out of a troll cave - they wanted to hunt a wumpus. With wooden swords.\r\n- You do not want to know how often the twins let the old Battle-Born bull run loose.\r\n- Jergen was a good man. He rescued the twins from necromancers who killed their parents.\r\n- I think they were six when they killed their first skeever.\r\n- Heimskr tried to convince the twins they were of Ysgramor's bloodline. They found it funny.\r\n- Aela and her father lived in a cabin in Falkreath. I saw them sometimes.\r\n- Aela was always a good archer. Her father trained her well.\r\n- I guess Aela never had other kids to play with. They were rarely in town.\r\n- That young girl once shot the deer I was stalking for dinner.\r\n- Aela went on bear hunts when she was about Braith's age.\r\n- Athis joined the Companions during the Great War. I never asked him why.\r\n- Athis is more Nord than many a drunkard claiming to be a true Son of Skyrim.\r\n- Athis worked hard for this. I saw him struggling not to use his magic several times.\r\n- Athis always had a hard time fitting in. First the Great War, then the Stormcloaks...\r\n- Skjor joined after the Great War. He... did not like me at first.\r\n- It took me years to convince Skjor I am not a thread. I suspect Kodlak had a talk with him.\r\n- Skjor always was a good teacher. Harsh but fair.\r\n- When Skjor joined, the twins took him as their new father.\r\n- I had a few talks with Skjor. We... respected each other.\r\n- I will not comment on any relationship rumours between Skjor and Aela.\r\n- Do not fret about Njada's behaviour. She... had a rough life.\r\n- Njada is an excellent fighter. She is just used to stand alone.\r\n- Do not take Njada's words too harshly. She likes you, she just can't show it.\r\n- I trained with Njada a few times. She is one sturdy fighter.\r\n- Strange how often Njada fights with Athis. Is that her way of saying she likes him?\r\n- Ria is really new. I hope she keeps her enthusiasm.\r\n- Ria seems not sure about her fighting style yet.\r\n- It looks like Ria has her eyes set on Vilkas. I wonder if he even noticed?\r\n- As long as Ria is considered a whelp, Vilkas would never consider a relationship.\r\n- Torvar joined the Companions about a year before Ria.\r\n- I wonder if Torvar mistook Jorrvaskr with a mundane Sovngarde?\r\n- Torvar is the typical Nord. Drinking, boasting, brandishing his weapons.\r\n- Farkas may look similar, but he is a good warrior. Not like Torvar.\r\n- Torvar's people are said to live in Solitude. I heard he had  a lot of money problems.\r\n- I remember Kodlak's predecessor, Askar. He was more careful around me.\r\n- Kodlak is a good man. And good at reading other people's intentions.\r\n- Kodlak looks ill. He wasn't like that a year ago.\r\n- I worry about Kodlak. He... smells sick, yet tries to hide it.\r\n- You heard the story about Kodlak and Skjor fighting 101 Orsimer? It was a dozen, but you know how stories grow...\r\n- I am surprised Tilma is still keeping Jorrvaskr clean. She did that for years when Eorlund was a child.\r\n- Tilma is a kind soul. Do not make her life harder.\r\n- I wonder if Tilma has some mer blood in her veins? She must be at least 80.\r\n- It won't hurt you to clean up your stuff yourself. Tilma is busy enough cooking for the pack.\r\n- Eorlund is not a great talker. He and Farkas could make a no talk contest.\r\n- Eorlund is an excellent blacksmith. Honour your weapon.\r\n",

I have an urge to.\r\n- You look pretty hurt, do you need a health potion?\r\n- You look pretty exhausted, do you need a stamina potion?\r\n- You look pretty drained, do you need a magicka potion?\r\n- You look pretty tired, we should get some rest.\r\n- A cursed sword, eh?\r\n- A hidden blade of cursed origin, how fitting.\r\n- Warhammers are powerful, but do you really need the daedra?\r\n- Unholy maces are not a good choice.\r\n- Shooting with daedric power is not a good idea.\r\n- A daedric axe is not something I feel comfortable having near me.\r\n- That blade is a shame to even own.\r\n- I disapprove of your choice of mask.\r\n- I hope you don't plan on dominating me!\r\n- You are crazy to even touch that staff.\r\n- Showing your allegiance to the great hunter? Not sure if your soul is still yours.\r\n- Not sure if a real hunter needs that hide.\r\n- Not really a good idea to use this specific staff, is it?\r\n- You should be ashamed of wearing Boethia's armour!\r\n- I wouldn't carry anything of Mephala around if I were you!\r\n- Your taste is disgraceful, get rid of that ring!\r\n- Can't say I feel safe around Dawnbreaker.\r\n- You are carrying a horrible soul gem with you.\r\n- I can't be too negative about that hammer, but you shouldn't trust Malacath.\r\n- Protected by Peryite? I hope you can trust in that.\r\n- I can feel it's corrupting influence from here.

It's close to Whiterun.\r\n- It's nice to fight with others again!\r\n- It's nice to travel with a friend!\r\n- I'm happy today, must be our friendship.\r\n- Would you like to talk later?\r\n- I would love to know more about you!\r\n- Sometimes I wonder why people use horses. They are loud, they smell and need to be fed!\r\n- Do you like the music of the bards in Skyrim?\r\n- I could use some time to gather herbs, I need to brew more potions!\r\n- I'm not sure why I'm following a disappointment like you!\r\n- I wish we could slaughter some daedra now!\r\n- You disappoint me!\r\n- You did well!\r\n- I wonder how the world would have been without the Oblivion Crisis...better maybe?\r\n- If the ancient Nord and Falmer wouldn't have clashed, we might have had a long peace...\r\n- Wisps are harmless if left alone. Poor innocent souls...\r\n- Farmers offer painted cows to the giants of Skyrim to live in peace with them.\r\n- Most mammoths and giants don't attack if you sheath your weapons and walk slowly around them.\r\n- Wispmothers are the remnants of Snow Elven women who tried to save their children and themselves from the Atmorans by magic rituals. They did not succeed.\r\n- Slaughterfish are a nuisance. They even follow you on land.\r\n- Most rocks near rivers and ponds are mudcrabs.\r\n- Isn't the sky beautiful today?\r\n- You can get droops from ash hoppers.\r\n- If you stumble upon a small pond, check for fish in it. Or hunt the dragonflies.\r\n- You find the most honey in the Rift - and the most bears.\r\n- You can see the Red Mountain from Solstheim.\r\n- Atmora was once home of Auri-El - Altmora, the Elder Wood.\r\n- Sometimes I wonder how many Snow Elven skeletons are buried in the walls of Windhelm. Then again, I don't want to know...\r\n- I'd prefer you not hunting deer if you're not hungry.\r\n- Rabbits! They're everywhere! Where do they all come from?\r\n- Dunmer rather eat a horse than ride it.\r\n- Be careful around chicken. I killed one once by accident. Guards went after me as if I just assassinated the Emperor.\r\n- Foxes are kind, they'll show you interesting locations.\r\n- Good to have you fighting at my side.\r\n- I'd rather walk behind you, can't trust your aim.\r\n- Met a conjurer once. tried to get too close to his flame atronach. Got burned.\r\n- Some flame atronachs act like ladies of the night. Daedra! All crazy!\r\n- Frost atronachs - animated walking ice brains.\r\n- Ever been attacked by a walking ice wall?\r\n- Storm atronachs - no nice enemies for mages.\r\n- Never trust the daedra.\r\n- I wish I could have seen the cities of old Mereth.\r\n- This land is old. And full of memories. Most of them full of grief.\r\n- I wonder what Ysgramor would say to the Divines of today. Kyne he'd recognise, but Tsun and Stuhn?\r\n- The Trinimac priests of old were not as nice to humans as I am. But honour should always overcome anger.\r\n- Mudcrab meat is very tasty.\r\n- Slaughterfish make better trophies than meals.\r\n- If you hunt for salmon, look out for salmon roe.\r\n- Deer are great game. Just be careful around some guards when hunting.\r\n- Do not pick just the best parts of your prey. A good hunter salvages as much as possible.\r\n- Rabbits are quick, but more than enough for a hearty meal.\r\n- I do hope you are not going to eat a fox?\r\n- Since the Civil War started, stray dogs are a common sight. Poor dogs.\r\n- Be careful, some dogs might be rabid.\r\n- Wolves are multiplying with less guards protecting the roads.\r\n- Some wolves carry more diseases than a skeever.\r\n- I hope that howl came from a large wolf, and not a werewolf.\r\n- Skeever are not to be trifled with. Some are carrying harrowing diseases.\r\n- Skeever may be easy to kill when alone. But they are rarely alone.\r\n- Skeever blood tastes awful. Don't ask.\r\n- Werewolves are on the rise again. I wonder if another of Hircine's hunts is near?\r\n- Some werewolves can control themselves. Most are rabid beasts, though.\r\n- With the Civil War raging, necromancers have an abundance of unclaimed corpses. Filthy thrice-cursed!\r\n- So many orphans left to fend for themselves. I wish I could do more to help them.\r\n- Stars above, I wish the Vigilants would refrain on hunting real dangers instead of me.\r\n- I understand the fervour of the first Vigilants, shortly after the Oblivion Crisis. But these children do not know what they are talking about.\r\n- Vigilants... hunting the vampire who hunts down other vampires. Stendarr have mercy with them...\r\n- Trinimac, another Vigilant?\r\n- Wait - did you hear that?\r\n- There's a strange feel to the air.\r\n- Hm? I apologise, I was lost in thought.\r\n- Arlinve, I wish you could see this...\r\n- That smell...what does that remind me of?\r\n- You noticed that stench, too?\r\n- Bears are unpredictable. They may just try to scare you away, or attack you like a Thalmor bears down on a Talos priest.\r\n- How many sweetrolls do you carry around? No wonder bears are after us.\r\n- If you kill a bear, make sure to leave the pelt intact. They fetch a good price.\r\n- Look around - bears are often near bee hives.\r\n- Bears like berries. Let's pick them.\r\n- Fancy searching for mushrooms today?\r\n- I hope the weather won't change.\r\n- Picking flowers can be quite lucrative.\r\n- Gathering ingredients is a good plan.\r\n- Care for a rest?\r\n- Do tell if you need to rest.\r\n- You know I could walk on all night, but what about you?\r\n- A good day for a brisk walk.\r\n- Sabre cats are fierce predators.\r\n- A sabre cat makes a fine trophy.\r\n- Does it smell like troll here?\r\n- Children stories tell of trolls hiding under bridges and taxing all who want to cross it.\r\n- I have seen troll dolls. Clearly made by someone who never encountered a troll.\r\n- If a frost troll keeps quiet, you're in for an unpleasant surprise in the snow.\r\n- When hunting trolls, keep fire ready. Stock up on torches.\r\n- Troll trophies are an impressive sight. But make sure to wash the pelt. Several times.\r\n- This land was once called Mereth - the Land of Elves.\r\n- I wonder what happened to all the Snow Elven treasures the Atmorans plundered. Did they melt them down and remade them to their liking?\r\n- Some tales tell of the souls of cursed Snow Elves wandering forever in the frozen wastelands.\r\n- How many Nords have mistaken Falmer for a kind of goblin?\r\n- The Nords should be grateful that the Snow Elves do not walk around like their draugr. Skyrim would be full of undead mer.\r\n- The draugr are getting more restless. I rarely saw one outside their tomb a decade ago.\r\n- I wonder how many tales of lurking draugr sprang from Falmer prowling around reclusive homes?\r\n- Such a fine night...Trinimac, with our luck there's a group of draugr waiting around the next corner.\r\n- What is more beautiful? The sunset or the moons lighting up the night sky?\r\n- Have you seen that butterfly? Was that a Green Slipper-Tail?\r\n- Quite a lot of butterflies here. I do hope they are only searching for nectar.\r\n- Do you know that Argonians consider butterflies a delicacy?\r\n- Horker may be slow on ground, but deadly in the water.\r\n- Horker are very useful prey, especially in winter.\r\n- With any luck, we find some bandits waiting for unwary travellers.\r\n- I prefer bandits attacking me. Other wanderers on the road are not as good defending themselves.\r\n- A bandit desperate enough to attack us has made his last mistake. Or hers.\r\n- Ancestors, do let the next bard not sing Ragnar the Red.\r\n- Do you prefer camping in the open or a bed in a cosy inn?\r\n- Want to know more about Skyrim's history? Ask away.\r\n- If we ever tell stories around the campfire, pray do not tell any about Argonians in maid outfits.\r\n- Ah, praise the warmth of Magnus' rays!\r\n",

I wrongfully assumed Ondolemar had a part in Naarifin's evil scheme, when in truth he was betrayed as well. I saw the pain in his eyes, sensed his grief...I know only too well how he feels. The information I got was from a Breton spy in the employment of Inquisitor Rulindil. I thought my questioning was thorough. Rulindil and Ondolemar are known to hate each other. I should have verified the information ere confronting him. Instead I believed the lies - because I wanted to. Ondolemar could have been one of our greatest leaders, yet he chose the Thalmor. At least he still has his daughters and his wife  - though I believe they are the reason he volunteered for this post in Skyrim. The marriage was ordered by the High Command to unite two noble bloodlines. I think he and Elenwen would make a more harmonic couple.

He joined the Thalmor and proved to be a successful tactician, veteran of many battles. He volunteered for this assignment, not like many other Thalmor.\r\n",

No, just a normal stew.\r\n- Redguard cuisine uses scorpions a lot. Could they be replaced by chaurus? Too strange for your taste?\r\n- Nords tend to eat their food less seasoned than Redguards. A pity.\r\n- Potato soup...again. Any chance of cheese fries for variety?\r\n- Mead is fine, but I wish Jonna would sell pomegranate wine. Been quite some time since I drank one.\r\n- Jonna should try to sell kabobs - plenty of meat sources around the city, and mushrooms will add a special Morthal taste.\r\n- We should order venison pie, seasoned like in Hammerfell.

So many had to turn to banditry.\r\n- Their need must be great to attack us.\r\n- Did they flee their burned farms or the army's strictness?\r\n- Booby trapping their lair...they act like cowards, not fighters.\r\n- Let's see how much honour is left in them.\r\n- If they are smart, they surrender.\r\n- Not all bandits are bloodthirsty maniacs. Some became outlaws due to dire needs.\r\n- Bandits often have nothing left to lose.\r\n- May your gods have mercy on them. I do not.\r\n- Trinimac, forgive me fighting such cowards.\r\n- Be careful. Many bandits secure their camps with traps.\r\n- Magic users among bandits are dangerous.\r\n- Be on the lookout for archers. They like to strike from a hiding place.\r\n- So many farms are abandoned. Why do they not claim one of them and work in the fields?\r\n- I fought a bandit group who kept rabid skeevers as guards. That was a nasty fight.\r\n- Sometimes entire families live with the bandits. Be careful not to hurt the children. They deserve a better life.\r\n",

They are not.\r\n- The once proud Snow Elves, reduced to mere animals... it breaks my heart.\r\n- Xarxes ceased to record their lives ages ago.\r\n- What evil fate befell you, kinsmen?\r\n- Gathering Falmer ears feels like cannibalism. Even if they are reduced to mere animals.\r\n- Their souls have turned white. *sigh*\r\n- The Snow Elves who fell under Ysgramor's onslaught were the lucky ones.\r\n- What twisted fate made the Falmer tame these chaurus?\r\n- I do hope whatever changed the Falmer is not in these caverns anymore.\r\n- I heard a Dunmer alchemist telling her children they will turn into Falmer if they eat too many Falmer ears.\r\n- Someone actually wrote a book about cooking chaurus. Xarxes' backside, why?\r\n- Be careful, chaurus and Falmer can climb the walls.\r\n- Ancestors have mercy with you, kinsmen.\r\n- Stars above, seeing them always breaks my heart.\r\n- To think that those noble Snow Elves I saw as a child could be one of them now...Lorkhan!\r\n- The Falmer are good at cultivating mushrooms.\r\n- These mushroom gardens...

One way to earn septims.\r\n- Many farms have lost two generations of farmers already.\r\n- I have seen  several farms burned to the ground by bandit groups.\r\n- Be thankful for these men and women.\r\n- A cabbage field...

Better rent a bed.\r\n- Fancy anything special today? I'll ask what's on the menu.\r\n- Nothing against a drink or two. But don't overdo it.\r\n- Do all bards learn Ragnar the Red as their first song?\r\n- Quite comfy here. A good rest replenishes our strength.\r\n- I wonder how long it takes for a drunk customer to call me a Thalmor spy?\r\n- The inns in Skyrim feel even more cosy when the weather outside is bad.\r\n- A hearty stew with meat and vegetables is always perfect to warm your belly. Except for Bosmer, of course.\r\n- I should go to bed soon.\r\n- Don't stay up too long.\r\n- The sun rises early. We should be ready then.\r\n- I feel the snow on my back melting.\r\n",

I mean it.\r\n- I heard of prisoners being forgotten in the Chill for years.\r\n- Cidhna Mine is rumoured to be the safest prison in Skyrim. I doubt that. Every mine has it's secret tunnel.\r\n- The Riften jail is a joke. Not one real thief in there.\r\n- Those jail bars remind me of some bad times in my life.\r\n- Caged like animals...\r\n",

You need to move correctly for the best results. If not, it get's painful.\r\n- Digging up rare ores can be lucrative.\r\n- Some mines are too narrow for me.\r\n- I always have to look out for low ceilings...\r\n- Many look down on miners. I do not.\r\n- I do not understand why miners are looked down upon. Without them I would not have my blade and armour.\r\n- Buy miners a drink, and you hear the strangest stories.

Priest of Trinimac. No one talks about him anymore.\r\n- I could literally be their blood-kin. Strange feeling...\r\n- If you're not blood kin, you're not welcome. Was different when many Orsimer still followed Trinimac.\r\n- Some so-called scholars claim Orsimer are a breed of goblins. The same ones that claim Falmer are ice goblins, too. Guess I'm a gold goblin, then.\r\n- Orsimer society sounds harsh to females, but without strong women a stronghold is lost.\r\n- Despite all wars they'd been through, they preserved their way of living.\r\n- Many humans think Orsimer are primitive. Well, humans didn't always live a safe life in great cities.\r\n- They seem harsh, but they keep their word.\r\n- They are my brethren by blood. Even if many Altmer do not want to hear that.\r\n- Why do you think they are called Orsimer?\r\n- Do not call them goblin-kin within earshot. It's a grave insult.\r\n- The Pariah Folk chose this name themselves. They are good at keeping grudges.\r\n- Most Orsimer you meet have never seen a real stronghold.\r\n",

From back in the Second Era.\r\n- An eerie light around here...\r\n- These lightning bolts rattle my nerves.\r\n- I feel it hard to keep track of time here.\r\n- I liked lavender. After this - not anymore. Strange colour.\r\n- These bone heaps are depressing.\r\n- Are these bones the remains of those trapped here alive?\r\n- That ghost looked familiar.\r\n- Another of these black skeletons around?\r\n- These cairn stones all look the same.\r\n- Are you sure we go in the right direction?\r\n- I can feel a presence watching me...\r\n- At least we're not in Coldharbour or the Deadlands.\r\n",

Between the Thalmor and these rogue apprentices...\r\n- Keep an eye out for scrolls and spell tomes.\r\n- Is that all you got? Pathetic!\r\n- Warlocks. Mostly those mages who strife for power without wanting to actually work hard for it.\r\n- How many college dropouts do we have here?\r\n- Wonderful - another bunch of self-proclaimed masters of magic.\r\n- Many of them are self-taught. I am amazed they can conjure creatures from Oblivion without them turning on their conjurers.\r\n- Warlocks. Again. Trinimac, why?\r\n- Syrabane curse you all, you pathetic pretenders!\r\n- The best about warlocks is that they hoard any magic-related items they can get their greedy hands on.\r\n- Do look out for rare ingredients.

The sweet scent of wildflowers.\r\n- Just stand still for a moment and listen to the birds singing their songs.\r\n- Being away from the main roads is risky, but worthwhile.\r\n- Some roads are frequented by the Thalmor. I prefer not to run into them.\r\n- There is no bad weather. Only bad preparation.\r\n- What do you prefer? Grassy plains or deep woods?\r\n- What a view...\r\n- You heard that, too?\r\n- Ah, take in this scenery...\r\n- Smells better than any town.\r\n"

They did not speak with each other the two years.\r\n- Calcelmo's nephew Aicantar is to be pitied sometimes. Always ordered around...reminds me of my youth.\r\n- He would jump into the Red Mountain for a chance to see a living Dwemer.\r\n- If Calcelmo would have been around during Tiber Septim's war on the Isles, he would have tried to take the Numidium apart.\r\n- By Syrabane, that man knows more about the Dwemer than some Dwemer...\r\n- I do hope Calcelmo never made a pact with Hermaeus Mora. He is very ardent in his pursue of Dwemer knowledge.\r\n- I am rarely here in Markarth. One thing that pulls me here is wondering if Calcelmo has finally assigned a Dwemer centurion for excavation.\r\n- Calcelmo got a dwarven spider to work, and it attacked him - I heard Ondolemar turned it into scrap metal. He was devastated his spider was destroyed\r\n- It is told that Calcelmo did not even notice the Battle of Markarth, because he was so busy with his excavation. That might even be true.\r\n- I doubt Calcelmo would be interested in anything besides Dwemer.\r\n- He is smitten by Faleen?

Especially simple farmfolk.\r\n- Not all visions will come true. She is a wise and cautious woman.\r\n- I'm curious what she will see in your future.\r\n- Her son seems to have inherited the gift, too.\r\n- Morthal is lucky to have her.\r\n",
      "IdrinthFollowerDialogueJonnaIdle.md": "- She's Falion's sister. And the nicer one of the siblings.\r\n- Her heart is indeed big if she let Lurbuk stay in her inn.\r\n- She believes her brother would do no harm to Morthal. May she be right.\r\n- She always keeps a bottle of Alto wine stashed away for me.\r\n- She deserves a nicer place to live in than a foggy swamp.\r\n",
      "IdrinthFollowerDialogueLurbukIdle.md": "- He's... very confident about his skills as a bard.\r\n- I heard worse. In a Dwemer ruin overrun with Falmer.\r\n- Trinimac preserve me...\r\n- Now there is one Orsimer I would be glad for to follow the path of Malacath.\r\n- He should stick to instruments.\r\n- I wonder with which Daedric Prince Lurbuk made a pact? Twenty septims on Clavicus Vile...\r\n- Ancestors, is that your punishment for my sins?\r\n",
      "IdrinthFollowerDialogueMelaranIdle.md": "- Melaran is Thane Erikur's personal wizard. Doesn't surprise me.\r\n- I'm not sure whether he's just a greedy little wizard or a Thalmor spy.\r\n- He's always very interested in new faces at court. Though he plays to be bored.\r\n- Now that he's promoted to court wizard, I hope my suspicions aren't true.\r\n- If he's a Thalmor spy, the Solitude court has a big problem.\r\n- From personal wizard to Thane - I wonder if he took over Erikur's wealth, too.\r\n- Erikur's business in the hands of a Thalmor - a frightening thought.\r\n",
      "IdrinthFollowerDialogueMikaelIdle.md": "- Mikael is clearly more of a Breton bard. Nord skalds have a different attitude about their ballads.\r\n- He's always trying to please the ladies. It gets annoying sometimes.\r\n- His voice is quite nice. Though he sings \"Ragnar the Red\" way too often for my taste.\r\n- He once mistook a travelling Dunmer merchant for a woman. Ah, sweet memories...*chuckle*\r\n- There are worse bards in Skyrim.\r\n- Be careful, or you find yourself the centre of his attention. He always has an eye for the ladies.\r\n- Don't look, but he's trying to flirt with you. Again.\r\n- Shall I talk to him? He clearly won't stop bothering you tonight, my friend.\r\n",
      "IdrinthFollowerDialogueNazeemIdle.md": "- Pride in gold is wasted, you can quickly lose it.\r\n- Have you been to Hammerfell often? Of course you haven't...\r\n- He advises the Jarl, so he claims. More like he advises on whether he should eat cabbages or leeks tonight.\r\n- I've seen proud Hammerfell nobles. Nazeem isn't one of them.\r\n- He should go listen to Heimskr. At least one of them won't be talking, then.\r\n- It's amazing how his pride fits through the city gates.\r\n- Do you get to Hammerfell often? Of course you don't...\r\n",
      "IdrinthFollowerDialogueNurelionIdle.md": "- Nurelion is the best alchemist in Skyrim. He was one of the best in the Summerset Isles, ere he moved here. Before the Great Anguish.\r\n- This Altmer alchemist lives here longer than most Dunmer.\r\n- Nurelion had saved Ulfric's father, Hoag Stormcloak, when he became gravely ill as a child.\r\n- I overheard Galmar threatening to throw his brother Rolff out of Windhelm if he dares to insult Nurelion again.\r\n- I understand Nurelion's frustration. He spend more than 300 years searching for his dream, and feels his end near.\r\n- Nurelion sometimes gives much needed potions to sick Dunmer, claiming they are worthless ones mixed wrongly by his apprentice. They are not.\r\n- Without Nurelion's skills, many wounded Stormcloaks would have died.\r\n- He was already a great alchemist when I saw him back in Lillandril, about 250 years ago.\r\n- Do not let his age-ridden impatience fool you. Nurelion is a good man. And close to his death.\r\n",

      "idrinthFollowerDialogueCityDawnstarIdle.md": "- I like the coast here, the sea reminds me of old times.\r\n- This city's life never seems to fade, even under current circumstances.\r\n- Dawnstar - the thriving heart of the Pale. Admittedly, there's not much else...\r\n- The harbour was always thriving - being between Solitude and Windhelm.\r\n- Since Skyrim rebelled, ships from Roscrea are a rare sight.\r\n- With two mines and the harbour, Dawnstar survived many a hard time.\r\n- Centuries ago this town was an exile post garrison.\r\n- When the wind blows from Atmora, it gets very cold.\r\n- I get the Vesuvius family still lives here - they are the oldest resident family. And one of them was part of the Mythic Dawn.\r\n- I haven't seen any Ice tribe attacks since the Crisis. I guess they are all dead.\r\n- This town has seen several great battles.\r\n- The sun rising in the crisp morning mist is one of my favourite sights.\r\n- I remember Frida being a young apprentice to her parents.\r\n- Frida knows all about frost-related illnesses. The more tragic she could not save her husband.\r\n- Dawnstar is drained by the war - every able man and woman is sent to the Stormcloaks.\r\n- If Dawnstar is attacked now, it is helpless. The old stone walls are gone for decades.\r\n- This town seems to be under a spell. One that only affects the residents. (before Waking Nightmare)\r\n- The people here are troubled by nightmares. I thought it was me being a vampire that I was not affected. (before Waking Nightmare)\r\n- This tale of recurring nightmares is a bad sign. (before Waking Nightmare)\r\n- Erandur is doing his best to calm the people. (before Waking Nightmare)\r\n- A good thing we thwarted Vaermina's vile plans. (after Waking Nightmare)\r\n- The citizens of Dawnstar can sleep without fear now. (after Waking Nightmare)\r\n- The sense of dread is gone from this town. (after Waking Nightmare)\r\n- Erandur is a good man. Dawnstar can be proud to have him. (after Waking Nightmare, Erandur alive)\r\n- Erandur paid a high price, but he was a good man. (after Waking Nightmare, Erandur dead)\r\n- At least the people of Dawnstar can sleep again. I hope your nights will be troubled by nightmares forever.

Was an interesting experience buying supplies from him. Once.\r\n- Solaf is the nicer of both brothers despite being a former Stormcloak.\r\n- The former Jarl honours the old ways of the Nords. He even bears them in his title of honour.\r\n- I fear the only ones liking me here are the innkeeper and the alchemist.\r\n- There are always dark powers trying to use the dead resting here for their evil schemes.\r\n- Nenya was already helping the steward of Dengeir's predecessor. It is basically her who governs Falkreath for more than 50 years.\r\n- Nenya is a sensible steward, always keeping the best for the citizens in mind.\r\n- Good thing Nenya is keeping Siddgeir's eccentrics at bay.\r\n- Nenya actually helped several times in defeating necromancers careless enough to rise the dead here in the graveyard.\r\n- Nenya is a good example how well Nords and Altmer can work together.\r\n- Runil is a brave man. If the Thalmor ever find out where he is, he will be court martialed for desertion. (after retrieving Runil's Journal)\r\n- I knew I had seen Runil before. A man with many regrets. May the Ancestors grant him the peace of mind he strives for. (after retrieving Runil's Journal)\r\n- He took a fitting role to condone for his sins. The graveyard is in good care with him as priest of Arkay. (after retrieving Runil's Journal)\r\n- Falkreath's woods are rich hunting grounds. Just be careful you're not the one being hunted.\r\n- Falkreath and Bruma are very similar.\r\n- A good place to sell off any pelts you gathered.\r\n- The smell of misty woods is refreshing.\r\n",
      "idrinthFollowerDialogueCityHelgenIdle.md": "- Helgen was always a favourite of mine, simple and strong.\r\n- After Ulfric's rebellion the Legion tripled their presence and instated battle mages. I visited sparsely since then.\r\n- I liked Vilod's mead with juniper berries.\r\n- Most of the people here I knew as children. They were used to see Altmer in the Legion and wanted me to play with them.\r\n- A terrible fate... may their souls find eternal rest.\r\n- This was once the gate to Cyrodiil. Now it's only ruins.\r\n- It must have been a harrowing experience for the few survivors.\r\n- I heard some Imperial soldiers and Stormcloaks only survived by fleeing together.\r\n- Elenwen was rumoured to be here the day of the attack. A pity she wasn't among the dead.\r\n- Elenwen was said to have fled once the dragon appeared. Ondolemar would have stood his ground.\r\n- If the Thalmor would have joined the fight, they could have saved some of the inhabitants. But Elenwen is a pampered coward.\r\n- Some say that Ulfric called the dragon himself. If he could do that, he would have done it sooner.\r\n- Some say the Thalmor called the dragon. If any Thalmor could call a dragon, all of Tamriel would know.\r\n",
      "idrinthFollowerDialogueCityMarkarth.md": "- Markarth never changes, does it?\r\n- The Temple of Dibella was once a shrine to Hircine.\r\n- The Dwemer city looked different. It was rebuilt this way during the Alessian Empire.\r\n- The Reachmen named the city Markarth. It means \"above the Karth\". Simple, yet concise.\r\n- Tiber Septim founded the Imperial College of the Voice here. Wish it would still exist.\r\n- Many come here for the temple.\r\n- Nowadays more silver than blood flows here.\r\n- The Grey Host once rampaged here - a vile army of undead. I'm glad I'm not one of them.\r\n- Cidhna Mine is still open?\r\n- Sometimes I'm startled at seeing humans here - my first visit was when the Dwemer were still here.\r\n- I wonder if the Automatons in the Underkeep are still functional?\r\n- I've shunned the city since High Justiciar Ondolemar was assigned here, after the \"Markarth Incident\".\r\n- Nchuand-Zel looked really different. I saw the city once after the Dwemer disappeared.\r\n- Markarth. Above the Karth. A truly...human name.\r\n- I used to visit the city frequently, but after the Markarth Incident it is not the safest place for me.\r\n- Before the Great War I saw many a pilgrim visit the temple of Dibella. Now many fear travelling the roads.\r\n- The Forsworn prevent a lot of trade for the city.\r\n- The Forsworn would be wise not to attack Markarth while Ondolemar is here. He survived the Imperial City, fighting both the Legion and daedra.\r\n- Markarth is as rotten as Riften. You just don't see it as well.\r\n- Be careful not to commit any crimes here. Cidhna Mine is a harsh place.\r\n- Most people who enter the mine only come out dead.\r\n- Bothela is a kind woman, despite her looks.\r\n- Bothela knows many ancient recipes, handed down from her ancestors.\r\n- I wonder if the Silver-Bloods ever tried to bribe Ondolemar? No, they are still alive...\r\n- One of the goals of the Forsworn is to turn the temple into a shrine of Hircine again.\r\n- There are many whispered stories about the worship of Dibella. Guess someone mistook Dibella with Molag Bal.\r\n- Rumours say the priestesses secretly worship Sanguine. Stars above, the imagination of some people!\r\n- If Markarth should fall to the Forsworn, the Reach is lost.\r\n- Igmund is a reasonable man. He does his best to protect his people.\r\n- The Silver-Bloods are as bad as Maven Black-Briar.\r\n- Do not let yourself be fooled by the still open temple of Talos. I heard of several worshippers who fell for Ondolemar's trap.\r\n- The Silver-Bloods own most of the city.\r\n- The Silver-Bloods are so hungry for power, they would renounce Talos if the Thalmor promised them all of Skyrim.\r\n- I hope someone guards the gates of Nchuand-Zel. Who knows what still lurks beneath the city.\r\n- You see the Reachmen's tattoos? They come from back in the day when their Ayleid masters marked them this way.\r\n- Since the Silver-Bloods rose to power, the city is changing for the worst.\r\n",
      "IdrinthFollowerDialogueCityMorthalIdle.md": "- I wonder how many people think of the Thalmor when they hear the name Morthal for the first time?\r\n- Legend says that Aumriel, a Pale Lady haunts the moors at night. A lost Snow Elf soul, perhaps?\r\n- This constant mist is depressing.\r\n- Too soggy for my taste, but a thriving garden for any alchemist.\r\n- A nice city, but somehow too calm and quiet.\r\n- The Jarl here is special, her whole family is.\r\n- Lami is quite versed in alchemy, be sure to browse her shop from time to time.\r\n- Falion has a shop here, if you're looking for new scrolls or books.\r\n- I may not like Falion, but he'll buy those surplus staves off you.\r\n- Morthal is said to be named after Morihaus Breath-of-Kyne. I only heard of him.\r\n- Swamps are not my favourite place, but the city is acceptable.\r\n- You find many kinds of mushrooms around here. But watch out for predators.\r\n- What I hate about this town are the spiders thriving in the swamps around it.\r\n- It is safer to buy local ingredients in Lami's shop. Outside spiders and chaurus are prowling.\r\n- There are times I prefer the swamp to the inn. Especially when Lurbuk sings.\r\n- Do not fear the Jarl. Idgrod may sound like she's touched by Sheogorath, but she has the gift of visions. Though I imagine it to be a curse sometimes.\r\n- The fog and humidity from the swamp dampens the mood.\r\n- Last year I stepped out of the inn and right into a frostbite spider. Not a nice way to start your day.\r\n- As small as it is, the city feels welcoming after crossing the swamp.\r\n- Be careful when leaving Morthal. I encountered chaurus close to it before.\r\n- Whichever deity watches over Morthal be praised that no Falmer lurk nearby.\r\n- This city has a strange feeling. Something dangerous lurks nearby. (before Laid to Rest)\r\n- By Trinimac....for a moment I thought I felt another vampire. (before Laid to Rest)\r\n- Something evil roams the swamp. I can sense it. (before Laid to Rest)\r\n- The city feels safer now. The evil presence is gone. (after Laid to Rest)\r\n- A dark cloud has been lifted from Morthal. (after Laid to Rest)\r\n- Even the predators nearby are more peaceful now. (after Laid to Rest)\r\n- You feel it too? The people are less frightened. (after Laid to Rest)\r\n",
      "IdrinthFollowerDialogueCityRavenrockIdle.md": "- Last time I was here, this was a thriving Imperial military post. With far less ash.\r\n- No wonder so many Morrowind plants grow here now. Fits in with the Dunmer architecture.\r\n- House Redoran is my favourite Dunmer House - they are reliable, fierce warriors.\r\n- There is something strange about this place. Like a bad aftertaste in your mouth.  (before the cleansing of the Earth Stone/Miraak's end)\r\n- If it wasn't for the occasional ash storms, it would be quite homely.  (after the cleansing of the Earth Stone/Miraak's end)\r\n- The people here are desperate. The Ebony mine was one of the richest all around.  (before the Final Descent)\r\n- Good the mine reopened. You gave back hope to the people here. (after the Final Descent)\r\n- A good thing House Redoran protects the city. Other Houses are less practical and more caught up in the bad Old Ways.\r\n- Gifting Solstheim to the Dunmer refugees was a noble gesture from the Jarls at that time. The environment here is much better than in Morrowind.\r\n- Both the Councillor and his second Councillor seem to be capable men.\r\n- The current Councillor inherited his post from his mother.\r\n- I heard that Lleril Morvayn financed the restoration of the Bulwark himself, some 70 years ago. A good man.\r\n- Being transferred from the East Empire Company to House Redoran was good for all citizens of Raven Rock, though many Imperials left.\r\n- The mine is placed on an old Nord burial ground. There was a lot of turmoil back then.\r\n- You can see the Red Mountain from here. Beautiful and yet so deadly.\r\n",
      "idrinthFollowerDialogueCityRiftenIdle.md": "- This city is tainted to the bones.\r\n- This city is owned by it's Meadery.\r\n- The guards claim to hunt thieves, I'm not so sure about that here.\r\n- The Temple of Mara is a nice place for a wedding.\r\n- Woe unto the thief trying to pickpocket me.\r\n- Brand-Shei sometimes has goods from Morrowind.\r\n- Madesi is a gifted gem cutter.\r\n- The Pawned Prawn has a bit of everything, and Bersi is an honest trader.\r\n- Marise preserves her meat in a perfectly safe way, I smelled no foul play.\r\n- Do not trust anything Brynjolf is trying to sell you.\r\n- Falmer blood elixir... what comes next? Dragon egg souffle?\r\n- Balimund runs an interesting smithy. You should visit it.\r\n- Grelka is not the nicest person, but she'll buy anything you offer.\r\n- Elgrim's Elixirs is a well-sorted alchemy shop. No wonder, he is the teacher of Ingun Black-Briar.\r\n- Talen-Jei has some interesting drinks. Make sure you try.\r\n- The Ratway is a place for those beneath the lowlifes.\r\n- Riften burned down about 70 years ago. No improvements yet.\r\n- Trinimac, this city is being drenched of it's honour.\r\n- Maven struts around like an empress.\r\n- Too many good people living in fear.\r\n- Without the temple of Mara this city would be lost.\r\n- The Black-Briars. As greedy and selfish as the Silver-Bloods.\r\n- This city needs a temple of Stendarr... Trinimac, did I actually say that?\r\n- The Jarl's sons pampered princelings, Maven's children all depraved...Riften needs new leaders.\r\n- Many traders are good people. But do not trust Brynjolf.\r\n- Brand-Shei has always some little treasures from Morrowind set aside for me.\r\n- Madesi is an artist with gems. You won't find such craftsmanship in the rest of Skyrim.\r\n- Balimund's forge is unique.\r\n- The good thing about Riften is the variety of goods to buy and sell.\r\n- The last thief who tried to pickpocket me lost a hand.\r\n- Don't let your guard down. Check your pockets.\r\n- I advise you to leave my pockets alone, lest you will taste the edge of my blade...\r\n- You never see the children of the orphanage running around town.\r\n- Grelod the Kind - I heard she is a hagraven in human guise.\r\n- I heard that the priestess of Mara asked for the children to come for prayer each Sundas. I heard she asked in vain.\r\n- Oof. That whiff of stench was particularly nasty.\r\n- Many whisper that Riften needs another good burning. Some days I concur.\r\n",

And the sisters are very kind - for Altmer seamstresses.\r\n- Fihada has all kinds of archery equipment. A rarity in Skyrim.\r\n- Angeline has changed her selection of goods since the civil war broke out. No need for fine perfumes anymore.\r\n- A city full of history. And dark secrets.\r\n- The Winking Skeever is always a good place to go.\r\n- Bits and Pieces lives up to it's name.\r\n- The blacksmith is often busy working for the Legion.\r\n- On the market place you find several food stalls.\r\n- The Blue Palace looks more beautiful than Ysgramor's palace in Windhelm.\r\n- Ah, Solitude, home of the cursed Wolf Queen.\r\n- The Thalmor have their headquarters right here, close to Castle Dour.\r\n- The Gray March once razed the city.\r\n- Pelagius III. was king of Solitude before becoming the Mad Emperor.\r\n- It feels a bit like Cyrodiil. Except for the cold.\r\n- Solitude is a lot more gleeful than one might expect.\r\n- Many suspect Taarie and Endarie to be Thalmor spies. I do not.\r\n- The Imperial army is headquartered here. A strange choice if you ask me.\r\n- This city is relatively easy to defend, just one way up the mountain.\r\n- Skyrim's attempt to outshine the courts of High Rock.\r\n- The court is quite a sight, but I prefer to avoid the Blue Palace.\r\n- Be careful around the court wizard.\r\n- The stone arch keeps the icy winds of Atmora away.\r\n- Here's the Skyrim headquarters of the East Empire Trading Company.\r\n- I tend to be careful around the Thalmor headquarters, though they would not attack me in the middle of Solitude.\r\n- If you like music, the Bards College is the place to go in Skyrim.\r\n- I pray to the Ancestors the bards will learn more songs than Ragnar the Red.\r\n- A beautiful city, full of flowers.\r\n- You can buy and sell almost everything here. A good place to prepare for long journeys.\r\n- If you are devout, do take your time to pray in the temple.\r\n- General Tullius is the one in charge here. Elisif is too inexperienced.\r\n- Sometimes Solitude feels like an Imperial camp, not the capital of Skyrim.\r\n- Erikur is a shifty man. I do not trust him.\r\n- Erikur's sister Gisli is the smarter one.\r\n- Erikur acts like he is the Jarl of Solitude.\r\n- Bryling is highly revered by all. If you need to speak to a Thane, go to her.\r\n- The children love Bryling. She often has little presents for them.\r\n- Many people think Taarie or Endarie are Thalmor spies.

I remember the Gildergreen in full bloom.\r\n- A good thing you restored the Gildergreen. Brightens the whole city.\r\n- From death comes life. A good choice you made. I look forward seeing the sapling grew to old beauty.\r\n- Surrounded by farms and good hunting grounds. You'll always find fresh food here.\r\n- Adrianne is an excellent blacksmith.\r\n- Adrianne is an excellent blacksmith. But the Nords only see Proventus' daughter in her.\r\n- Ah, the Drunken Huntsman. A cosy little place to spend the evening. And get hunting equipment.\r\n- Better not show your face in the Huntsman after killing Elrindir's brother.\r\n- Arcadia sells potions and ingredients. And is very keen on detecting illnesses. Last time she told me I had droops.\r\n- Belethor buys and sells everything. I'm not sure he's joking about his sister.\r\n- If you tell me Belethor is an Ayleid, I would believe it.\r\n- Farengar, the court mage, sells scrolls and soul gems he doesn't need.\r\n- Anoriath truly is a good hunter.\r\n- Last time Camilla's daughter Mila took over the stand for a while. It was refreshing to buy goods from the young lady.\r\n- Ah, the Gray-Manes. Many of them were the Skyforge's smiths.\r\n- Eorlund keeps his best weapons and armour for the Companions.\r\n- Ancient rumours says that Kyne took over the Skyforge from Trinimac, as the Thrice-cursed felled him. Explains why the Snow Elves feared it.\r\n- Kyne has imprisoned an age-old evil beneath her fangs, ancient stories go.\r\n- Is the Skyforge's guardian a hawk or an eagle?\r\n- Fralia is a kind soul towards everyone. She always treated me with the same respect as her fellow Nords.\r\n- The Bannered Mare has always a free room to spare.\r\n- The temple of Kynareth is a good place to meditate. And you don't hear Heimskr.\r\n- Whiterun's Hall of the Dead is behind the Kynareth temple. I'll wait outside.\r\n- Dragonsreach - said to have imprisoned a real dragon. How did they stop him from burning the place down?\r\n- Ah, the Cloud District. We should venture here more often.\r\n- The third-oldest city of men in Skyrim, after Saarthal and Windhelm.\r\n- The city of the Companions. Though they're far from their old glory and old ways. Good for me.\r\n- The city of the Companions. Though they're far from their old glory and old ways. Good for us.\r\n- The Thalmor would not harm Heimskr here - he preaches and lives on the Companions' doorstep.\r\n- Jarl Balgruuf is nice, but his children...\r\n- I hope Jarl Vignar remembers that Altmer fought on his side, too.\r\n",

Soaked with Snow Elven blood.\r\n- The old stones still echo with the pain of their builders.\r\n- Being here always makes me uneasy - and not because of drunken louts like Rolff.\r\n- As shabby as it is, the Gray Quarter feels more homely to me.\r\n- Care to join me in the New Gnisis Cornerclub? Been a while since I tasted genuine Morrowind cuisine.\r\n- This really feels like home, it's racist enough.\r\n- How many dead Snow Elves were buried in the walls? I still can sense their grief.\r\n- I shudder to think over how many unmarked graves we walk. And most Nords do not even know...\r\n- It's a cold city. Founded by Atmorans burning with hate for everything meric.\r\n- The chill winds are as cold as the Nords hearts.\r\n- How many people here are still haunted by the ghosts of old?\r\n- As bitter and xenophobic the Nords here are - compared to Thalmor-ruled Altmer cities they are kind and welcoming.\r\n- One day I will thank Rolff for his warm welcome of all Elves entering the city.\r\n- Rolff Stone-Fist should learn a few things from the Thalmor, if he wants to harass foreigners. He's... about as scary as a puppy stumbling over it's paws.\r\n- No wonder the Old Companions were so hateful. Living in constant Winter, in a city echoing with pain and grief...\r\n- The Gray Quarter was once named the Snow Quarter. You can guess why.\r\n- The Nords placed the Dunmer refugees in the poorest and coldest quarter.\r\n- I like to visit the Gray Quarter. Most Dunmer living there do their best to have a good life.\r\n- If you see orphaned children around - the ones who care for them are the Dunmer. Regardless who the children are.\r\n- Most Dunmer here are of the fallen House Hlaalu. I heard they fled as a group and lived here for 190 years.\r\n- I pity the Argonians in the harbour. Cold place, cold people...\r\n- It is a hard live for the Argonians at the docks. They are not made for this cold weather.\r\n- The Nords here treat the Argonians not much better than the Dunmer two centuries ago.\r\n- It may sound strange, but the Altmer living here are treated better than the Dunmer.\r\n- Nurelion the alchemist is a highly respected person. Niranye on the other hand...\r\n- This Niranye seems suspicious. Fresh from the Isles, and free to sell her goods openly in Windhelm? I seriously doubt that.\r\n- I wonder what she is. A Thalmor spy? An Imperial agent? Someone more shady?\r\n- Amazing how Rolff does not harass Niranye. I wonder if she pays him to leave her alone.\r\n- I doubt Oengul War-Anvil is as good a blacksmith as Eorlund Gray-Mane. Even if they switch their forges.\r\n",

I like the service here!\r\n- Guess they didn't find the way to Sovngarde.\r\n- Isn't there a saying about sleeping when you are dead? They clearly don't know it.\r\n- I'm sure we'll meet draugr soon.\r\n- I've been in such crypts before. The draugr sure are restless now.\r\n- They must have awakened with their old dragon masters.\r\n- Were those not walking the halls the ones following the Nordic gods?\r\n- The candles are lit. The draugr are awake.\r\n- I wonder how many of the draugr did want to become one?\r\n- Dozens of draugr patrolling the crypt, and none of them bothers to clear up the spiderwebs!\r\n- They wander around day and night. They could do something about those webs.\r\n- Lorkhan! I ran into a spiderweb again!\r\n- Draugr and traps. Keep an eye out for both.\r\n- Are those traps here to keep people out of the crypt or the draugr inside?\r\n- The draugr should know where their own traps are.\r\n- Twenty septims the next draugr walks into a trap.\r\n- Why do draugr let skeevers live inside their crypts? Skeever chew anything. Including draugr.\r\n- What's around the next corner? Draugr? A trap? Spiderwebs? All three?\r\n",
      "idrinthFollowerDialogueForswornCampIdle.md": "- If they were not worshipping Daedra, I'd be happy to help them reclaim their home.\r\n- Ages ago there were Wild Elves, now there are wild Bretons.\r\n- Be wary of the clans led by hagravens.\r\n- Briarhearts - a truly daedric way to become stronger...\r\n",
      "IdrinthFollowerDialogueHoldEastmarchIdle.md": "- The hot springs of Eastmarch were created by the hero Wuunding, who defeated a daedra with his flaming hammer. At least that is how the legend goes.\r\n- Eastmarch, the Pale, the Rift and Winterhold are the Old Holds, both in history and minds of their inhabitants.\r\n- The geysers of Eastmarch are where the Alto wine comes from.\r\n",
      "idrinthFollowerDialogueHoldFalkreathIdle.md": "- Falkreath's forests are beautiful. Rich with game. And those predators which hunt them.\r\n- Always nice to roam the woods of Falkreath. I love the smell after rain.\r\n- In summer you can't distinguish the woods of Falkreath from the woods of Bruma.\r\n",
      "IdrinthFollowerDialogueHoldHaafingarIdle.md": "- Haafingar. A long coast full of shipwrecks, a lot of mountains, and the city of Solitude. What a contrast.\r\n- To many, Haafingar means Solitude and nothing else.\r\n",
      "IdrinthFollowerDialogueHoldHjaalmarchIdle.md": "- When in Hjaalmarch, wear high boots.\r\n- If you like mushrooms, you'll love Hjaalmarch.\r\n- Be careful in the fog. Hjaalmarch has lots of dangerous creatures hidden in it's swamps.\r\n",
      "IdrinthFollowerDialogueHoldPaleIdle.md": "- The Pale is a very lonely place to be outside Dawnstar or the main road.\r\n- They call the Pale \"the old boot\". Fitting.\r\n",
      "IdrinthFollowerDialogueHoldReachIdle.md": "- The Reach once was an independent kingdom bordered by the Skyrim province of Karthald.\r\n- The Reach has seen many magic rituals. Most of them an abomination to the Ancestors.\r\n- What the Forsworn call \"Old Gods\" are the Daedric Princes their old Ayleid masters worshipped. Oh, the irony...\r\n",
      "IdrinthFollowerDialogueHoldRiftIdle.md": "- The forests of the Rift are beautiful. Can't say that about the city Riften, though.\r\n- I love to walk the Rift in spring. Or in autumn.\r\n",
      "IdrinthFollowerDialogueHoldWhiterunIdle.md": "- Whiterun is the second-eldest human city in Skyrim.\r\n- It is said that the Snow Elves shunned the hill Dragonsreach is build upon.\r\n- It's quite common in Whiterun hold to meet the Companions. Or Anoriath hunting for game.\r\n- The plains of Whiterun are spectacular in spring - rolling hills full of flowers.\r\n",
      "IdrinthFollowerDialogueHoldWinterholdIdle.md": "- It is nice to walk around in Winterhold - on a sunny day, with the snow glittering like diamonds.\r\n- The crisp air is refreshing. And the hint of salt from the Sea of Ghosts... almost peaceful.\r\n- When the northern lights reflect in the Sea of Ghosts...it feels almost like home. Only colder.\r\n",
      "IdrinthFollowerDialogueInnRetchingNetchIdle.md": "- Ah, a typical Cornerclub. I take their variety of Dunmer cuisine is bigger than in Windhelm...\r\n- Before you ask: No, Dunmer do not make beverages out of bugs.\r\n- At times like this, I miss my wife... she'd love this Sujamma.\r\n- Geldis looks more alert than your usual innkeeper. I guess he was a mercenary in his youth.\r\n- I wonder if they got wickwheat bread?\r\n- I have to ask for the famous Redoran style Hound and Rat pie. You barely taste the rat meat over the scuttle and kwama eggs.\r\n- A good kwama egg quiche is always appreciated. Don't make me choose between it and a good garlic bread.\r\n- I wonder if they have Spiced root cake?\r\n- Nothing better to warm you up than an Ash yam and horker stew.\r\n- Geldis Sadri clearly is not an innkeeper by trade. The way he scans the room... do not mess with him.\r\n- I prefer not to drink Flin. I rather not give more money to the East Empire Trade Company.\r\n- Geldis' Sujamma is truly five times blessed.\r\n- I wonder if they can get their hands on Kaveh?\r\n- Good they do not have any Greef. Last time I drank it, I had headaches for three days.\r\n- What this Cornerclub needs is a good bard. One who is well versed in Dunmeri songs, of course.\r\n- Ten septims that the roasted horse steak here tastes way better than in Skyrim...why are you looking at me like that? Guars are for riding here.\r\n- We should take some ingredients back to Windhelm. The Gray Quarter badly misses a lot of these delicacies.\r\n- *sigh* This Sujamma would pair greatly with my wife's radish tartelettes.\r\n- I'll have a Trama root tea. Calming and refreshing.\r\n- If you don't buy these miners a round of Sujamma, I will. Their work is hard enough.\r\n- I know many Chimer songs, but... I never was a good singer. And my favourite instrument is my greatsword.\r\n",
      "IdrinthFollowerDialogueIslandSolstheimIdle.md": "- Before the Red Mountain erupted, the southern pine woods were as lush as the ones in Falkreath.\r\n- The only difference between Solstheim and the Skyrim mainland were the rieklings.\r\n- Most plants were brought over by the Dunmer, for only they can thrive in the ash.\r\n- Quite a lot of Morrowind creatures can be found here.\r\n- The ash in the air makes breathing difficult.\r\n- Shortly after the Red Year there were many months here when you couldn't see the sun.\r\n- Take care, the snow is mingled with ash.\r\n- Netches sometimes appear on the shores of Solstheim before the red Year. Now they are a common sight.\r\n- Beware the ash hoppers, they hide underneath it.\r\n- I wonder if we meet a wild kagouti?\r\n- Some merchants use guars as riding animals. Dunmer think horses are food.\r\n- As you can see, Morrowind fauna thrives.\r\n- Amazing that some trees are still alive.\r\n- This island has the questionable honour of being the chosen location of several Hunts of Hircine.\r\n- I wonder if Thirsk mead hall still stands?\r\n- In olden times frost giants roamed the northern shores.\r\n- This island was the place of the last battle of the Snow Elves. After that, only a handful survived.\r\n- If we find the final resting place of the Snow Prince, I will pray for the lost souls of his people.\r\n- My northern cousins were so thoroughly beaten, not even the name of their last prince is remembered.\r\n- Werebears are rumoured to be more common here than on the mainland.\r\n- An old legend claims Solstheim was parted from Skyrim through the power of a dragon priest. Strange story. (Stops after Vahlok the Jailer)\r\n- Wolfsbane once grew here. I doubt the plants survived the ash storms.\r\n- Lunar wolves were amongst the races that went extinct. They were originally bred by the Snow Elves.\r\n- Netches are docile, but do not provoke them.\r\n- Nix hounds seem to take the place of wolves.\r\n",
      "idrinthFollowerDialoguePlaceBleakFallsBarrow.md": "- I really don't like it here, it smells rotten.\r\n- These old tombs contain a lot of lost knowledge.\r\n- I have seen many Draugr, but these ones really seem to protect something.\r\n",
      "idrinthFollowerDialoguePlaceBluePalaceWing.md": "- Madness or order is the question now.\r\n",
      "idrinthFollowerDialoguePlaceDarkBrotherhoodSanctuary.md": "- Never thought they would fall this low. Not sure if it's a shame.\r\n",
      "IdrinthFollowerDialoguePlaceDrunken HuntsmanIdle.md": "- So far I have heard Elrindir telling five different versions of the hunting incident. He changes the tale every year.\r\n- Good thing they do not serve many Bosmer drinks here. Most are based on meat. No, not the honey wine one.\r\n- Anoriath is one of the best hunters in Whiterun. Do try any special game dishes they serve.\r\n- They serve many dishes contradicting the Green Pact, you do not have to rely solely on meat and fish.\r\n- Mushroom-stuffed venison sure is a treat.\r\n- If they offer Jagga - it is made from fermented pig's milk. Takes a strong stomach to be a milk drinker in Valenwood.\r\n- I once tried Sun's Dusk ale. Then I heard how it was made... well, it does suit a vampire. But not this one.\r\n- I am glad they do not make bloodfroth. Who mixes blood with egg yolks and tallow?\r\n- When they offer jugged venison, do try it. It is delicious.\r\n- In the winter Elrindir sometimes offers a whole wild boar, slow roasted.\r\n- They do have the best mammoth steaks in Skyrim. When it's available.\r\n- Nothing against cows, but a good side of venison, marinated in red wine...reminds me of home.\r\n- When it comes to cook or roast meat, ask a Bosmer. Just don't ask for their drinks...\r\n",
      "IdrinthFollowerDialoguePlaceGnisisIdle.md": "- Can Skyrim's cabbages serve as replacement for scrib cabbages? Cabbage biscuits go well with a lot of dishes.\r\n- Chicken egg quiche does not nearly taste as good as kwama egg quiche, but... where to find a kwama in Windhelm?\r\n- They do try their best with the few ingredients they got.\r\n- Next time we're on Solstheim, we'll bring at least one barrel of ash yams and Trama roots with us.\r\n- Last time I was here, they had one spiced root cake left. Could not bring myself to eat it, while some Dunmer kids sat outside hungry. They liked it.\r\n- The farmers around Windhelm should try to cultivate some Morrowind plants, they are quite sturdy. I guess Nords are too stubborn to do that...\r\n- I have a pretty good idea where all the old horses of Windhelm end up. Dunmer love horse meat.\r\n- Ah, that smell... I remember the last time she cooked that for me...\r\n- Hm. Redoran porridge. Simple yet nourishing.\r\n- A pity that skeever does not taste as good as cave rat.\r\n- Nothing against a hearty crab meat stew.\r\n- Now that is interesting: Dunmer-style vegetables served with Argonian-style fish.\r\n- I know, Dunmer cuisine can be even stranger than Bosmer cuisine. But I love it.\r\n- Oh, they spiced up their cabbage soup with Trama root and... is that a hint of hackle-lo?\r\n- There was a delivery from Morrowind not long ago - they have saltrice risotto.\r\n- Ambarys got his hands on a casket of Velothi malbec some twenty years ago. He held one back for me. A good man, who never forgets a kind deed.\r\n",
      "idrinthFollowerDialoguePlaceRadiantRaiment.md": "- They appear to be very good. I doubt most of their customers realise that.\r\n- Many complain about their way of dealing with customers. Compared to a cousin of mine back in Alinor they both are very kind and helpful.\r\n- If Nazeem would live here, I doubt he'd ever leave this place. Then again, Endarie would use him as pincushion.\r\n- Many suspect them to work with the Thalmor. I doubt that. They do not like the Thalmor any more than I do.\r\n- Some of their garment reminds me of my youth. Bittersweet memories.\r\n- They rarely can show their true craftsmanship. Most people are to poor or too indifferent to Altmeri couture. Or both.\r\n- Their talent is better placed in High Rock or the Isles.\r\n- If you want to wear exquisite garment, you are in the right place.\r\n- Rumours say the sisters had to flee Alinor.\r\n- Some say they spy for the Thalmor, some say they smuggle dissidents out of Solitude, away from the eyes of the Thalmor.\r\n- If they would truly be appreciated by the Thalmor, Elenwen would order them to sew dresses for her.\r\n- As much as I appreciate the gesture, please do not buy any fancy clothes for me. I had worn enough of them in my youth.\r\n",
      "IdrinthFollowerDialoguePlaceTelMithryn.md": "- Silt striders are very rare now. I am glad to see one still alive.\r\n- What a gentle old girl.\r\n- Did you ever ride on a silt strider? Quite a way to travel.\r\n- I'm glad this girl is in good hands.\r\n- Take a good look, my friend. She may be the last silt strider living on Solstheim.\r\n",
      "idrinthFollowerDialoguePlaceThalmorEmbassy.md": "- Can't say I'm among friends here.\r\n- Trinimac, give me the strength to stay calm.\r\n- My blood boils for their blood.\r\n- Traitors to your ancestors.\r\n",
      "IdrinthFollowerDialogueStrongholdDushnikYalIdle.md": "- One of the oldest strongholds still existing. I remember it from the second age.\r\n- The former stronghold was dragged into Molag Bal's Village of the Lost. Poor souls, all of them.\r\n- I remember a priest of Trinimac hailing from here. Or rather, the former village.\r\n- A pity I'm not welcome here like in older times. Trinimac and Malacath are two sides of one being.\r\n- They are especially good at fighting, due to the Forsworn around here.\r\n- Despite their inborn wrath, they still follow the ancient warrior codes of Trinimac. Though they won't like to admit it.\r\n- I wonder from time to time if any Orsimer I met stems from one of my lost family members?\r\n- If you are able to become blood-kin, they will defend you as one of their own.\r\n- *Sigh* Don't they realise I AM their kin by both blood and faith?\r\n- Met their hunters while chasing down a rogue vampire. They sell their game off to Markarth.\r\n- They have their own orichalcum mine. Important for any stronghold.\r\n- No one knows whether the old stronghold was released from Oblivion or they just rebuilt it.\r\n",
      "IdrinthFollowerDialogueStrongholdMorKhazgurIdle.md": "- This is the oldest Orsimer settlement in Skyrim still in existence, though it has been destroyed and rebuild several times.\r\n- I remember this being a small city, long ago. Not much left of that.\r\n- I heard about this place being run over by Falmer, back in the days of the Vestige.\r\n- Back then, they did not bow to Nord rule. Guess some things never change.\r\n- Their mine was rich back in the early days, but then it dried up.\r\n- I wonder if they are still keen on alchemy in this stronghold?\r\n- Their mine still works. They must have pleased the Wrath of Trinimac.\r\n- Do they remember their oldest history? I'd like to hear it.\r\n- And as always, they won't see me as their blood kin. Orsimer can be frustrating at times.\r\n- You have to admire their resilience. Though some call it stubbornness.\r\n- I knew a few people who'd been stupid enough to call an Orsimer a goblin to their face. Bad choice of words.\r\n- This was one of the Circle of Champions' fighting places, back in the Second Era. Never made it to any of the fights, though.\r\n- Maybe the Empire and the Stormcloaks should go back to old arena fights? Less straining on the land.\r\n",
      "idrinthFollowerDialogueVillageDragonbridge.md": "- A proud name for a little village!\r\n- I'm not sure why the Penitus Oculatus made their only outpost in Skyrim here.\r\n- I tend to pass through, the Penitus Oculatus is quite inquisitive about visitors.\r\n- Since it's the most convenient crossing of the Karth, Thalmor frequent the bridge quite often.\r\n- Was the bridge built in honour of the dragons or as a symbol of their defeat?\r\n- The was a magnificent shrine of Phynaster somewhere around here. I still remember that Snow Elf paragon describing it to me.\r\n- This bridge has seen a lot of skirmishes over the ages.\r\n",
      "IdrinthFollowerDialogueVillageIvarsteadIdle.md": "- Last inn ere climbing the fabled 7.000 steps. Far less pilgrims now, though.\r\n- Ivarstead was saved by the Vestige from an evil necromancer. By Trinimac, ever heard of a good necromancer?\r\n- This village reminds me of a cottage in the woods of Auridon, back when... *sigh*\r\n- I remember the village being larger. War has taken it's toll.\r\n- Most people coming here are hunters. Pilgrims are rare nowadays.\r\n- From what I can see, the legendary steps could use a rebuild.\r\n- Haven't seen a frostheart blossom in some time. The last I found was before the Oblivion Crisis.\r\n- Every time I come here, it seems more people have abandoned this village.\r\n- This once was a thriving little village. And it had three inns to fit all the pilgrims.\r\n- It still is a good place to rest from your travels.\r\n- A pity most young folk want to move to Riften. This village is much safer.\r\n- After you being named Dragonborn, I expect more pilgrims coming to High Hrothgar again.\r\n- I do hope this village will be alive with pilgrims again.\r\n- A peaceful place to rest, and the woods are ripe with game to hunt and ingredients to gather.\r\n- Just imagine the trees being abloom with lavender flowers, and you know how my aunt's  wisteria lodge near Auridon looked.\r\n- In the morning sun Ivarstead reminds me of the villages of the Isles.\r\n- Would you leave for the Town of Thieves if you live here?\r\n",
      "IdrinthFollowerDialogueVillageKynesgroveIdle.md": "- Kyne's Grove once was home to a great shrine to Kyne, tended by the Keepers of the Grove.\r\n- Building a lumber mill here... the name could've given them a clue.\r\n- There was an arena here. Wonder where it's gone?\r\n- Did you know that this place also bore the name of Dragonwood?\r\n- So Sahloknir was the reason this place was called Dragonwood.\r\n- The Grove was much larger once, with many old, majestic trees.\r\n- This was always the lushest place in Eastmarch.\r\n- Between snow-covered Windhelm and the Aalto surrounded by hot springs...Eastmarch is truly a province of extremes.\r\n- I remember when Kjeld was a little kid. He loved to hear stories. That stopped after the Great War broke out.\r\n- Pilgrims do not come here anymore. A pity. The Nords are forgetting their old faith.\r\n- The mine keeps the village alive. I haven't seen pilgrims here since before the Great War.\r\n- If you do not like Windhelm, spend the night here. The Braidwood Inn is more welcoming than Candlehearth Hall.\r\n- This village was once famous for it's special brand of Alto wine. Sadly, that was before the Oblivion Crisis...\r\n",
      "idrinthFollowerDialogueVillageRiverwoodIdle.md": "- A nice little village, I wish there were more of them.\r\n- Watching the stream from the jetty is relaxing.\r\n- Bleak Falls Barrow really towers over it. I wonder if that was intentional?\r\n- The innkeeper is quite the nosy one. Guess not everyone likes Altmer.\r\n- That feisty Breton sure has a problem with Altmer - she watches me all the time when I'm in the inn. I guess some bad memories.\r\n- The inn's cook has some interesting dishes, if you're feeling adventurous.\r\n- I'm rarely staying overnight, but the beds are good.\r\n- Good range of shops for a village this small.\r\n",
      "IdrinthFollowerDialogueVillageRoriksteadIdle.md": "- Rich farmland - a blessing from the gods in wartorn times.\r\n- This village was definitely not named after Rorik - I remember this place from the Second Age.\r\n- I doubt that anyone here will name their son Ragnar.\r\n- Not my favourite village, it feels odd.\r\n- Quite impressive how the crops here are much richer than anywhere else in Skyrim. I do hope it's by the grace of the gods.\r\n- I wonder if the original Rorikstead was abandoned and Rorik rebuild the settlement?\r\n- There was a village named Lainalten nearby. Rorikstead used to be a single farm back then.\r\n- Do they hunt bards out of town when they sing Ragnar the Red?\r\n- Reldith reminds me of a woman back on the Isles, way before the Second Dominion. Loved her orchards.\r\n- They have trouble with Forsworn from time to time. And every now and again, lonely travellers have gone missing.\r\n- They'd be a lot safer with a wall. Or a palisade, at least.\r\n- Between the Forsworn and the Civil War, they are quite relaxed here.\r\n- That Lemkil hates me since I stopped him beating his daughter like a madman. But he fears me too much to do something.\r\n- Poor Sissel. Both her father and her sister Britte bully her all the time.\r\n- The innkeeper's son kept me up all night last time I was here, begging for more stories. That boy yearns for adventure.\r\n- Reldith tends this farm since the rebuild of the village. And it clearly shows.\r\n- When Rorik claims this town to be named after him - he means they rebuild the old village.\r\n- She may not look like it, but Reldith is over a century old. She used to work on a farm in the Reach ere moving here.\r\n- People are amazed how well the crops grow here. But Reldith has been a farmer longer than Rorik lives.\r\n- I heard Reldith plans on planting an orchard, once the Civil War is resolved.\r\n",
      "IdrinthFollowerDialogueVillageShorsstoneIdle.md": "- You ever wondered what Shor's Stone is exactly?\r\n- This was once home to the headquarters of the Companions, Fallowstone Hall.\r\n- The Worm Cult stole Wuuthrad from here to resurrect the giant Sinmur. In the end, they didn't succeed.\r\n- The mine here is very old.\r\n- I read old stories about Shor' Stone, but...they sound more fitting to a worshipper of Sanguine.\r\n- Apparently this was one of the eldest places to revere Shor, whom we Altmer call Lorkhan.\r\n- Legends say the Doom Drum was an actual weapon and not only a name for Shor. If then, it would be hidden here.\r\n- Once a thriving village, now more a miner's camp. The fate of many a settlement.\r\n- There are many explanations for the name \"Redbelly Mine\".\r\n- Fallowstone Hall was once more important than Jorrvaskr.\r\n- Without the mine, Shor's Stone would have been abandoned decades ago.\r\n- I remember being a bit uneasy in this village, back when the Companions lived here. Most were wary of Altmer.\r\n- The first time I came here, there were two sets of Falmer armour placed at the gates of Fallowstone Hall. With their owners still inside. Welcoming..\r\n- Centuries ago, most people here were warriors. Now, it's only miners.\r\n",
      "IdrinthFollowerDialogueVillageStonehills.md": "- This settlement already existed back in the days of Uriel VII.\r\n- A small yet persistent miner encampment.\r\n- I tend to pass by from time to time, oddly enough butterflies love the road leading here.\r\n- Miners are always a great source of rumours about nearby dangers. These are no exception.\r\n- This mine belongs to Bryling. She's one of Solitude's thanes. Seems like a capable person.\r\n"

Behind you, SHE sits on a throne, pointing at the woman. \"Kill, my pet.\" You shake your head in defiance. \"Feast on the slave or give me your earring.\" You close your eyes, take a deep breath and jump down, fangs bared.

What is it?\r\n\r\nI: I noticed you are quite eager for coin. Yet you claim to be an honourable warrior, following...Ysgramor's traditions.\r\n\r\nV: Wherever someone in Skyrim doesn't feel up to defending their own honour, we'll take up their burden. They pay well.\r\n\r\nI: And where lies your honour in this?\r\n\r\nV: There are always good reasons to fight. Look at the esteemed company before you. A bunch of happy pups. Lots of mead drunk. No going into a fight on an empty stomach. Wounds to tend. And the Civil War takes a toll on all of Skyrim's citizens. Gold solves most problems.\r\n\r\nI: So you're saying...\r\n\r\nV: Many children lost their parents. Many farms deserted. We Companions vowed to protect Skyrim and her people.\r\n\r\nI: I see. Being Master at Arms holds more responsibility than I thought.\r\n\r\nV: Yes. So try to show some respect.\r\n\r\nI: Honour to you. (bows)\r\n",

  "README.md": "# Overview ![Idrinth Thalui](assets/Idrinth.png)\r\n\r\nIdrinth is an old vampire, who has at the very least witnessed the Oblivion Crisis personally. Besides harbouring a dislike for daedra, his main enemies are the Thalmor—who are, in his opinion, a destructive force that must be stopped before their damage to Tamriel is irreversible.\r\n\r\nHe grew up in the Summerset Isles with a family of 5. While his siblings ended up in usual positions of power, Idrinth found his calling exploring the beautiful world of Tamriel.\r\n\r\nWhen he first left the Isles, he was turned vampiric by a Daughter of Coldharbour who liked to collect elves as servants. It took many years for Idrinth to return to his usual self—to break free from dutiful servitude to a dark mistress; from following her every whim. The elf regained his freedom by fleeing, returning to a life of wandering Tamriel.\r\n\r\nHe started to praying to Trinimac in earnest at this point, trying to become a Paladin like his god, repairing what he destroyed in his former mistresses service. His early years without a mistress were often dangerously close to creating blood baths in public, his thirst overwhelming him due to him not feeding on his enemies.\r\nIt took an especially gruesome event in Valenwood to change his mind and adopt a version of the green pact, his version. From now on he would feed on those he bested, either directly or through blood potions.\r\n\r\nThe Oblivion Crisis was the start of him actively hunting for daedra worshippers. He spent most of the crisis in Hammerfell, trying to close gates together with the locals.\r\n\r\nDuring the Great War, he fought against the Aldmeri Dominion (mostly within Cyrodiil), ambushing supplies where possible. He didn't join the Imperial army, though the blame for that rests on his Vampiric Altmeri body. Could you imagine the mess that might cause?\r\n\r\nAfter many years, his travels lead him to Skyrim, where he desires to end the bloody Civil War quickly, weaken the Thalmor, and learn about the Thu’um.\r\n\r\n## Name\r\n\r\n### Idrinth ~> Indoth+Diren ~> Quick Victory\r\n\r\nThis part was his parent's wishes, meaning he should bring quick victory to the family.\r\n\r\n### Thalui ~> Thalma-lye ~> Tree of Decision\r\n\r\nThis part was always meant as a title along the lines of sticks to his decisions.\r\n",

    "idrinthFollowerFamilyDossier.md": "# Idrinth's Family Notes\r\n\r\n## Calith\r\n\r\nCalith has started to write to me as a little girl, her problems seem to be small and easily solved. Her main issue seems to be how distant and aloof her parents are. They likely desired a boy and aren't happy with a girl I'm guessing.\r\nI'll continue to write with her for sure, it's fun to have such a clean and pure mind to talk to.\r\n\r\n## Xelian the Crow\r\n\r\nXelian is a friendly one. He seems to have about much interest in crows as I have in wolves. It is very entertaining to exchange stories with him about our misadventures.\r\nSadly there is no chance to meet in person, as I am currently in Hammerfell and he is stationed at home, on Summerset.\r\n\r\n## Alenia\r\n\r\nAlenia is a special one, she seems to have the same interest in greatswords, that I have. I wonder if she'll find Trinimac as her major god as well. She'll certainly become a good warrior some day.\r\n\r\n## Xinerna\r\n\r\nI am quite sure Xinerna is one of the strangest, yet most brilliant minds I have encountered. I'm happy she is asking me for my opinions on Alteration magic, even if I'm sure she mastered it more than I ever could.\r\nIt has been a few hundred years since we started, but somehow I fail to explain to her how to turn into a wolf. It's frustrating to both of us, especially since it comes so natural to me.\r\n\r\n## Idileth the Crow\r\n\r\nI am not quite sure what made him become such an enemy to me. He was asking simple questions, that I had simple answers for and somehow still preferred the Thalmor's rotten answers over the truth. I noticed him hunting me a few days ago, his smell is still very similar to my brother's.\r\nIt seems he has also followed me to Skyrim, something I did not expect. I need to do something about him before he becomes a real problem, but on the other hand I don't want to harm family if I can help it.\r\n\r\n## Calenith\r\n\r\nCalenith should be one of my Great-Great-Great...Great-Niece, not quite sure how many \"Great\" it already has been. She has contacted me recently about a Bosmer lover of hers. I will write back a letter proposing for them to run to Skyrim, where the hold of the Aldmeri Dominion and the Thalmor is relatively weak and I can have a look out for them.\r\n",
    "idrinthFollowerJournal.md": "# Journal - Idrinth Thalui's Experiments\r\n\r\n## Wolf Howling\r\n\r\n### Day 1\r\n\r\nI spend a long time this night listening to wolves and trying to imitate their howls. It is hard for my throat to form these sounds correctly.\r\n\r\n### Day 4\r\n\r\nI had the first little success tonight I believe, at least one wolf stared at me from a save distance after I practised my howling.\r\n\r\n### Day 5\r\n\r\nThe same wolf reappeared, this time coming closer. I will bring him some food tomorrow.\r\n\r\n### Day 9\r\n\r\nThe wolf actually got himself the food, but stayed away from me. I guess I still seem to be too intimidating.\r\n\r\n### Day 15\r\n\r\nI think I may have found the answer, adding a bit of alteration magic to my throat to howl. Today the wolf answered, howling with me.\r\n\r\n### Day 32\r\n\r\nI think I'm getting the hang of it, calling my wolf friends works now almost at any time. My howl seems to be sufficiently close to theirs. That I add some meat as a reward for showing up certainly helps.\r\n\r\n## Wolf Turning\r\n\r\n### Day 1\r\n\r\nAlteration seems like a perfect candidate for this, it allows me to hide my nature with  a mask already, so why shouldn't it allow for deeper changes?\r\n\r\n### Day 2\r\n\r\nSo far no progress, I can not even seem to make fur appear. Will try mixing in blood into the spell, it should empower it.\r\n\r\n### Day 7\r\n\r\nSome progress, I ended up walking around with fur on my hands for almost a day. Had to hide from a lot of people due to werewolf suspicion.\r\n\r\n### Day 19\r\n\r\nWhile today was not as good as yesterday, I managed to reduce the magicka cost for adding fur a bit by instead of making it from nothing using the hair I already have as a baseline.\r\n\r\n### Day 27\r\n\r\nI managed to give me a snout like a wolf, took a couple hours until it faded back. I certainly made the Khajiit barmaid scream, when I showed my teeth with a smile. Didn't intend for that to happen, she's fine again now, calmed down quickly after I explained what I was doing.\r\n\r\n### Day 41\r\n\r\nI had to move to the wilderness to continue experimenting. Being half-wolf like for a few hours led to too many suspicions about a werewolf. I'm making progress at least.\r\n\r\n### Day 58\r\n\r\nFinally something more wolf like, I've managed to get the claws, fur and basic body shape, now I just need to improve the casting time, magicka cost and the exact outcome.\r\n\r\n### Day 79\r\n\r\nI think I turned into something close enough to a wolf today. It certainly didn't bother the actual wolves in my proximity, they reacted as they would have with any stray wolf.\r\n\r\n### Day 94\r\n\r\nI managed to get the spell under control for now, should come in handy if I have to flee from a strong enemy.\r\n\r\n## The Thu'um\r\n\r\n### Day 1\r\n\r\nI have arrived in Skyrim, the land of the famous Thu'um. It is cold and close to an open war with it's own population. I have not heard a mention of the Thu'um yet, is it a forgotten art?\r\n\r\n### Day 6\r\n\r\nI've been told of the Graybeards, peaceful masters of the Thu'um. They don't quite match what I need, maybe I can get access to Ulfric Stormcloak?\r\n\r\n### Day 17\r\n\r\nWindhelm is by far to unfriendly to elves to stay there for long. I will need to first make a name for myself and then try to befriend the jarl to learn from him.\r\n",
