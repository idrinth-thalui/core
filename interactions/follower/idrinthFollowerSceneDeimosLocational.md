## The Blue Palace

I: A court in fear. I wish we could do something about that.

I: (player favour > 700) Most people here remind me of children acting tough. The court wizard is a very different story though.

I: (player favour > 500) We need to be careful, Sybille smells of blood and death.

D: I’ve heard some stories here about some necromancers trying to summon the Wolf Queen not far from here. I’m not surprised they are in fear. Potema is powerful.

D: (Idrinth Player favour > 700) Yes. These people think way too much about themselves. Children acting tough are actually just people who are afraid. What comes to Sybille, you would know wouldn’t you?

D: (Idrinth Player Favour > 500) Curious. You have an awful good sense of smell. Something you want to say about that, Idrinth?

I: The Wolf Queen was a very tough enemy to beat when she was alive. I hope we don’t have to fight her again in her unlife.

I: (700 > Player Favour > 500): It’s nearly a stench, don’t you smell it?

I: (Player Favour > 700) She is old, has served a few Jarls before and has most of the court in her pocket. Noone wants her fangs to get too close, even if that is only something whispered behind her back.

I: (Player Favour > 800) Luckily she keeps the fangs to lawbreakers in the dungeon.

D: Oh I absolutely agree with you. Potema herself is one thing. But a weird, immortal version of her could mark the start of something absolutely terrible.

D: (Player Favour >500): Oh yeah. She reeks of undead.

D: (Player Favour > 700) Let’s keep an eye on her. Dragonblood invites… uninvited guests.
