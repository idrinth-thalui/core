## Drink 1

Repeatable, Idrinth player favour > 600, Idrinth Deimos Favour > 500, Deimos Background unknown, at an inn

I: Would you want to share a drink later? Unpoisoned of course. Talk about old times?

D: (If the player doesn’t know Deimos’s Background) Oh I’m always up for a drink but what do you mean about old times?

I: I thought you were a…student of history as well.

D: Oh yes. I have read a lot of books in my time and I do know things from that. If you want to share some of your knowledge, I’ll gladly share mine.

## Drink 2

repeatable, Idrinth player favour > 600, Idrinth Deimos Favour > 500, Deimos Age known, at an inn

I: Would you want to share a drink later? Unpoisoned of course. Talk about old times?

D: (If the player knows how old Deimos is) Oh I’m always up for a drink. We can talk about some things as well of course.

I: There were many things in the past that are worth talking about. And your perspective may be…unique.

D: As for sure yours will be. I’m sorry if I have come out too hard at times. I just didn’t know you that well and you probably know it hasn’t been easy for me to trust people after… well.. everything.

I: Wine or Ale, the inn should have both. Or something stronger perhaps?

D: I prefer mead. I must say the mead of the Nords might be some of the best in Tamriel. What would you like to get?

## Drink 3

Repeatable, Idrinth player favour > 600, Idrinth Deimos Favour > 500, Deimos max relationship, at an inn

I: Would you want to share a drink later? Unpoisoned of course. Talk about old times?

D: Oh yeah. I’m always up for a drink. Do you remember that time when we fought against each other in the Great War in the 4th era in 173? Oh dear those were the days.

I: One of the best fights I had in a while.

I: (Deimons Favour > 800) I have to say, you would likely have won given more time.

I: Maybe it was good we got separated by those mercenaries.

D: Oh I totally agree. You really were the only one putting up a real, tough fight.

D: (Idrinth Deimos Favour > 800) Won? Oh give me a break. There are no real winners in wars. I just wish we were fighting for the same side. We truly would’ve been unstoppable. The Mercenaries simply were in the right place at the wrong time going between us.
