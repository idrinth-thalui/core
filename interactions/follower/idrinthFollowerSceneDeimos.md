## Greetings

I: Greetings, I'm called Idrinth Thalui. What may I call you?

D: *Cautiously* Good to meet you, Idrinth. I am Deimos.

I: Deimos it is.

I: (player favour > 600) A name I’ve heard before I believe.

I: I’m glad to make your acquaintance. May you be a great help to us.

D: (Idrinth player favour > 600) That is entirely possible. I’ve been all across Tamriel in all my years of… exploration.

D: You do look like you can hold your own in a fight as well. May we protect our companion with our combined might. We are stronger together.

## Armour choice

I: When I last laid eyes upon an armour like this, it was in service to dark goals. I trust you are a loyal friend, not like you...r ancestor?

D: Hm.. I thought as much. No I’m not like my… Ancestor was. I don’t think we have ever met before.

I: I never asked, but the armour doesn’t look human made, is it of older origin?

D: Well.. To be honest I am not quite sure where its origins lie. It seems like a combination of Dwemer and something the Maomer would do. I did kill someone very powerful for it a long time ago.

I: Kill…as expected.

D: Well. Look at me. Do you think this hap… Nevermind. The point is, I wear this armour to honour someone. It also is a constant reminder of what I’ve done in the past. 

## Believes

I: I’m wondering who you follow. You may not be an Orsimer, but your behaviour could fit a Malacath worshipper. Am I wrong?

D: I have been betrayed by the Gods and other things one too many times. I don’t trust them anymore. I’ve heard you speaking about Trinimac in multiple cases. I’m surprised you aren’t a follower of Molag Bal knowing your… truth.

I: (player favour > 600)That is quite an accusation, for someone with your past.

I: (Deimos favour > 500) I hoped we were past petty insults.

I: The strong are there to protect the weak. Where the strength comes from matters less than how you use it.

D: (Idrinth player favour > 600) Protective, I like it. But you know absolutely nothing about me.

D: (Idrinth Deimos favour > 500) Oh I see how it is. Yes. I just don’t really like talking about the one I worship. Void can be terrifying if you aren’t careful…

D: I do agree with you on that. Where the strength comes from matters not. As long as you use it the correct way.

D: (Not necessary but it would be an interesting line if the player knows Idrinth well enough, but Deimos doesn’t know Idrinth.) I catch your teeth in my neck, you may find your teeth missing very fast.

## Drink 1

Repeatable, Idrinth player favour > 600, Idrinth Deimos Favour > 500, Deimos Background unknown, at an inn

I: Would you want to share a drink later? Unpoisoned of course. Talk about old times?

D: (If the player doesn’t know Deimos’s Background) Oh I’m always up for a drink but what do you mean about old times?

I: I thought you were a…student of history as well.

D: Oh yes. I have read a lot of books in my time and I do know things from that. If you want to share some of your knowledge, I’ll gladly share mine.

## Drink 2

repeatable, Idrinth player favour > 600, Idrinth Deimos Favour > 500, Deimos Age known, at an inn

I: Would you want to share a drink later? Unpoisoned of course. Talk about old times?

D: (If the player knows how old Deimos is) Oh I’m always up for a drink. We can talk about some things as well of course.

I: There were many things in the past that are worth talking about. And your perspective may be…unique.

D: As for sure yours will be. I’m sorry if I have come out too hard at times. I just didn’t know you that well and you probably know it hasn’t been easy for me to trust people after… well.. everything.

I: Wine or Ale, the inn should have both. Or something stronger perhaps?

D: I prefer mead. I must say the mead of the Nords might be some of the best in Tamriel. What would you like to get?

## Drink 3

Repeatable, Idrinth player favour > 600, Idrinth Deimos Favour > 500, Deimos max relationship, at an inn

I: Would you want to share a drink later? Unpoisoned of course. Talk about old times?

D: Oh yeah. I’m always up for a drink. Do you remember that time when we fought against each other in the Great War in the 4th era in 173? Oh dear those were the days.

I: One of the best fights I had in a while.

I: (Deimons Favour > 800) I have to say, you would likely have won given more time.

I: Maybe it was good we got separated by those mercenaries.

D: Oh I totally agree. You really were the only one putting up a real, tough fight.

D: (Idrinth Deimos Favour > 800) Won? Oh give me a break. There are no real winners in wars. I just wish we were fighting for the same side. We truly would’ve been unstoppable. The Mercenaries simply were in the right place at the wrong time going between us.

## Following 1

Deimos not know to be in Brotherhood

I: Why are you following him/her? Is that not against your nature?

D: I follow him/her because I am trying to do right by the lifetime of mistakes I’m carrying with me. Why are you following him/her even if he/she did ask for your help? I’m very curious as well. Aren’t the hunters of the night usually working alone?

I: I’m a servant of Trinimac first and foremost. An Altmer following his honour and his god’s will.

I: (Deimos Favour < 250) Aren’t people like you always on their own? On the run from the law and hated by most?

I: Bandits are most vulnerable when attacking them while they sleep.

I: (player is vampire/werewolf) Hunting in packs is not unheard of and makes it more efficient.

D: I don’t trust the gods anymore but that doesn’t mean I don’t trust you. I’ve seen what you can do and I’ve seen you truly are ready to protect and help those in need. (This could be an answer that might raise the favour)

D:(Idrinth Deimos Favour <250 Deimos age is known) You really don’t know me do you? I’ve left that long behind by now. When the years pass, you become invisible again.

D:(Idrinth Deimos Favour <250 Deimos age is unknown) What are you on about? Mercenaries are not hunted by the law. We are the ones that hunt those who break the law.

D: Oh yes. Sneaking around in the night for sure is the best way to catch someone off-guard. When they’re dead, perhaps have a snack afterwards. Wouldn’t you agree?

D: (Player is a vampire) Oh yes. Packs work awfully well as we’ve seen. I won’t join your vampire pack but I will fight by your side as always.

D: (Player is a werewolf) Pack? We are a weird mixture of things. One is a vampire, one is a werewolf and one is an experiment of some weird Ayleid Necromancer.

## Following 2

Deimos know to be in Brotherhood

I: Why are you following him/her? Is that not against your nature?

D: What are you talking about? I used to be in the Brotherhood for a very long time. It is our nature to follow Sithis and the Night Mother. We also help our brothers and sisters in times of need. Do you have something against me or my past Idrinth?

I: Sithis…I can’t say that makes me confident in your trustworthiness. I’m no brother to your…cult.

I: (Deimos Favour > 500) You do seem rather honourable for an assassin though, so I’ll rest my judgement and blade as long as he/she vouches for you.

I: I am mostly worried about your intentions, prey that doesn’t fear the predator is easier to kill.

D: Cult? Now who is the reclusive cannibal cult? You are not my brother. You never will be my brother. But trust me. If I need to kill someone, I will kill anyone standing in our way.. That does include you.

D: (Idrinth Deimos Favour >500) I have left that life behind a long time ago. I’m not an assassin anymore. These days I enjoy facing the enemy head on. No matter who they might be.

D: That is a smart thing to think. That is precisely the same reason I’m still a bit on edge with you. I do, however, believe we can work this out and actually start tolerating each other.

I: My honour demands that I don't hide and strike from the shadows.

I: (player favour >700)  I left the stalking of people behind me a long time ago.

D: Come now Idrinth. You’ve seen how I fight. Do I look like I strike from the shadows still?

D: (Idrinth player favour >700) That’s where we are the same. I am no follower of Sithis anymore. I just follow him/her and help.

## Mortals

The age of both is know

D: Hey, Idrinth. I’ve been curious about you. What sort of interactions have you had with the Mortals? Has anyone been in your life for so long they have noticed something is wrong?

D: (Idrinth Deimos favour >500) Hey, Idrinth. We have both lived long and we have both seen too much. Have you ever thought about the people you have lost? You knew they would perish before you. Doesn’t it make you feel.. guilt? I know I have felt that many times.

I: (Idrinth Deimos favour >700) I was married when I was young.

I: (Idrinth Deimos favour >800) She was a great mage among the chimer and later dunmer, but we missed a lot of our shared lifetime. We were not lucky.

I: (Idrinth Deimos favour >700) I visited my wife's grave until it was no more. After the red mountain exploded.

I: I keep away from too deep relationships and I’m always wandering. It helps to have some people who know and accept the truth, but they have been rare. I’m careful at choosing who to trust, I have been disappointed by men, mer, mortal and immortal too often in my life.

I: (Idrinth Player Favour > 600) He/she may be one of the few who know more about me, but then again, there is a reason I was…came to help them.

D: (Idrinth Deimos Favour >700) I’ve never been so lucky as to find anyone like that in my life unfortunately… Not yet at least. You just… never truly know someone. On top of that fighting is all I’ve done for almost my entire life.

D: (Idrinth Deimos Favour >800) I’m sorry to hear that. If I don’t dig up any bad memories, do you want to talk about it?

D: (Idrinth Deimos Favour >700) The explosion of the Red Mountain was a tragedy. I was not in Morrowind back then but I’ve heard how tragic it was for a lot of people.

D: That’s where we both are the same. People have a way of betraying those that love them the most. It has rarely happened to me but I have seen that happening to so many people.. Oh how low some people dare to fall. Well.. At least they have the privilege of death. Not everyone is so lucky..

D: (Idrinth Player Favour >600) He/She has that skill. Not many people know about my past either. I rarely share that willingly.

## Immortals 1

The age of both or one is unknown

D: Idrinth. Have you ever encountered any immortal beings like liches, dragons, daedra or something like that? In my opinion, fighting against them is annoying.

I: I’ve fought many daedra before, many vampires and a few younger liches. The arrogance a lot of these had was their greatest weakness. Their skills and knowledge always made it a challenge. Silver coating on your weapons helps a lot against most of them though.

D: You could even say that’s the… Silver lining that makes it possible. Sorry. I had to say it… Anyways, all of them have a weakness besides silver.

## Immortals 2

The age of both is known

D: Idrinth. Have you ever killed other immortal beings and fought against them?

I: Yes, mostly vampires and lesser daedra. They are pretty vulnerable to the silver coating on my weapon of choice, but often overlook that in their arrogance. Their skills and knowledge always made it a challenge to fight them. I actually enjoy battling them, they are worthy opponents, not like a lot of the over zealous Thalmor and Vigilants of Stendarr hunting me on their own.

D: Ah yes. Arrogance is a trap a lot of us fall into. We may be immortal beings but that doesn’t mean we can’t die some way or the other. I do agree that immortal beings are always worthy opponents. What’s the longest time you’ve been stuck in a fight with something? Mine was two months. The toughest fight in my life.

I: A literal fight? Maybe a few days to a week. I usually move away, when killing no longer seems an option and return better prepared.

I: (Player Favour > 500) I am still fighting my…mother's lackeys where I can find them, but that is more of a cold war. I am not powerful enough to deal a fatal blow.

D: (Only in the first option answer.) It was a lich. It made some sort of.. Barrier with its magic and I couldn’t escape and his phylactery was safe on the other side of that barrier. The fight only ended when the room itself gave out.

## Liches

D: Idrinth. Do you know how to kill a lich for good?

I: The liches that did not reappear usually had some item they boasted about. Destroying that seems to be sufficient, but I’m no expert in liches at all. I assume that it is something like a soul gem for them, but that is purely guesswork.

D: (If the player knows about the Ayleids that changed Deimos) You would be correct. It’s called the Phylactery. Their souls are stored there. Most of the time it is very well defended by the lesser undead for… obvious reasons. When Celemaril changed me, he wanted me to kill another Ayleid lich. It is never an easy fight but when they fall, it gives you enough time to destroy the phylactery.. Or even better. Take the soul in it for yourself and use it for something good.

D: (If the player doesn’t know about the Ayleids that changed Deimos) You would be correct. It’s called the Phylactery. Their souls are stored there. Destroy it, and you destroy the lich for good. Everyone has a weak spot.

I: Good to know, I'll keep an eye out for those! Thank you. Hopefully we can stay clear of Liches though.

## Thalmor

D: You probably knew we were going to talk about this at some point. What do you think of the Thalmor? I know you’re an Altmer yourself but I feel you despise the Thalmor, maybe even more than I do. I understand it from my own perspective, but to turn your blade against your own kind. That is very rare to see. Especially for Altmer.

I: I expected this question sooner to be honest. I am no fan of this version of the Thalmor, they bring shame on their names. I try to oppose them without killing too many Mer, but that is hard when they come like sheeps to the slaughter.

I: (Deimos Favour > 400, Player Favour > 400) Some of the older ones likely didn’t forget about my role in the great war, ruining their supply lines and forcing them to add more guards than usual.

I: (Deimos Favour > 600, Player Favour > 400) Some of their mages are old enough to know better how the Thalmor were meant to be. It’s especially sad to see them misuse the name and lead us all to death and suffering.

I: Most of all I despise their way of dealing with others. We Altmer are meant to be an example, a noble people. They turned the nurturing Thalmor into something that makes us seem like mad slavers at best.

D: To be fair this is a topic that I thought wouldn’t be easy. That’s why I decided to wait a bit. The sad thing is.. It’s very tough to oppose something like that without killing. Some casualties are necessary but I have to say. It is stupid how their pride denies them from running from a fight. An issue a lot of people seem to have these days.

D: (Idrinth Deimos favour >400, Player favour 400) Oh yes. I remember the.. stories about that. Still. It is stupid to think you’re the hunter but get hunted by the true hunter that was there. Back in the great war.

D: (Idrinth Deimos favour >600, Player favour >400) Yes. Unfortunately there is so much taint in the ranks of the Thalmor, that those who want no part in it or even better, want to oppose it, are also tainted in the eyes of the many.

D: Yeah.. Unfortunate but true. It is the recent generations that lead them to where they are today. Completely different from what they really were meant to be.
