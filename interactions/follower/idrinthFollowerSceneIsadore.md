## Hellos

Isadore: Hello I am Isadore, What's your name?

Idrinth: Greetings Isadore. I am called Idrinth.

Isadore: Ah Idrinth seems like a very strong name. Pleased to meet you.

Idrinth: You are very polite, you seem to have been raised well. The pleasure is all mine. Are you keeping to the green pact?

Isadore: I was born away from the Valenwood, my family had fled so I only know of a few things.

## Trinimac

Isadore: Idrinth can you give me the blessing of Trinimac?

Idrinth: I am not a priest.. I’m merely a believer myself. Giving blessings is outside my ability, but I could give you an amulet of Trinimac if you want to wear one.

Isadore: Oh okay I was just curious is all.

Idrinth: Curiosity is a good thing, if you keep it in check.

Isadore: Yes you are right. I may have to be careful.

## Blade and Magic

Idrinth: I see you are following the ways of both blade and magic. While I’ve seen that before, I’m curious as to how you learned to combine both.

Isadore: I always had a strong fascination about swords and blades.I attended mages guild lessons but all I wanted was a magic sword.

Idrinth: You could have gone with enchanting, it also could have given you a magic blade. I personally stayed away from conjuring one since using it in my first real fight.

Isadore: I suppose to me its an impressive type of magic. So I like to use it also if I happen to get disarmed.

## Valenwood

Idrinth: It has been a few centuries since I’ve been to Valenwood. Have you been there recently? Seen how it survives this Dominion?

Isadore: From what my mother had said it became a hunting ground for its new occupants. The Aldmeri came and took over.

Idrinth: That is the way all empires work. Luckily they tend to fall under their own weight, especially when mistreating their occupied territories. I hope it will happen quickly in this case.
Horns

Idrinth: I’ve noticed you are among the rare Bosmer with horns. I never asked, but aren’t they somewhat inconvenient?

Isadore: They can be a bit of a hassle like when a bed is too close to the wall you can hit them on things and that really hurts.

Idrinth: They must also be a hindrance when it comes to armor. Not only helmets, but most other gear could be caught in them.

Isadore: Yes for sure and making sure my hair looks good without hitting them with a comb. But I can't imagine not having them
Idrinth: Well, looking good is temporary anyway, don’t put too much emphasis into that…
