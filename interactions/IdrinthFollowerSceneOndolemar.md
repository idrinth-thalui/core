## Scene 1:

O: You ther, Altmer! What leads you to Markarth? Make it quick, but mind your tongue.

I: As charming as ever, Ondolemar. What's a superior bred mer like you doing here?

O: It's a necessary part of my job. I lead the Justiciars to root out the Talos heresy, and I'm here to make sure the Jarl of Markarth remembers that.

I: Interesting choice, Skyrim. Weren't most members of the Legion you killed from Skyrim?

O: The Empire exists because we allow it to exist. There is peace now, and it will continue as long as it serves our needs. Loyalty to the Emperor requires cooperation with the Thalmor.

I: I heard about your promotion. You managed to return most of your unit from Naarifin's failed attempt of sacrificing the Imperial City to the Thrice-Cursed. I do presume congratulations are in order?

O: Oh, absolutely. We proved the superiority of Mer over Man.

I: Strange, I heard your son and grandson didn't make it...Naarifin got them. Used them as sacrifices to his Daedric Mistress.

O: How dare you to speak of them in such a disgusting manner! I'd kill you where you stand if I wasn't bound by my oath as an officer of the Aldmeri Dominion!

I: I merely try to offer my condolences,  I always forget that you have a heart, even if it's frozen in ice.

O: Hmph, fine. I am done with you. You will leave immediately or I'll burn the flesh from your bones.

I: Charming as always, jorane ba alis.

O: What was that?!

I: Nothing. I'm leaving.
