# After Missing in Action, at the Skyforge

I: I'm glad we are back in Whiterun.

E: Fralia told me. You helped my boy? Well done.

I: You do not need to thank me. I try to save as many from the Thalmor as I can.

E: An honourable goal. Not many will do that. Even fewer elves.

I: I know...most fear them too much. Got any news from Thorald?

E: Aye, Vilkas brought a letter. He and Avulstein are safe back in Windhelm.

I: Good to hear. I hope they stay out of trouble.

E: Hrm. They better do. I notice your left shoulderpad is loose.

I: Yes. An unfortunate meeting with a bear.

E: I can fix that. As a thanks for my boys.

I: I would be honoured, mastersmith.

E: Come by anytime.
