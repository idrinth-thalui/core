# In House Gray-Mane, after Avulstein talked to you

A: Wait, I know you...I was a child...you helped us.

I: Yes. And I will help you again.

A: Ha, then Thorald will be safe! Like back when we encountered the skeever and...oh.

F: Skeever?

A: Ah, nothing, mother. Really.

F: My boys had trouble with a skeever?

A: Mom...we...nothing happened...

F: *sigh* You are more reasonable. Please tell me.

I: I found them outside Whiterun. Thorald, Avulstein and Idolaf.

A: It was Idolaf's idea...

F: Let him talk, Avulstein.

I: They wanted to pet a skeever and got bitten.

F: I see. And then?

I: I killed the skeever, healed them and brought them to the main gate.

A: Yeah, and scolded us on the way for being careless...

F: And he did right. You do have my thanks. Please help my Thorald once again. And you, Avulstein, we have to talk.

A: But mom...


# In House Gray-Mane, when convincing him to stay behind

A: I do not understand... you are a High Elf. And yet you help Thorald?

I: The Thalmor are my enemies as well. They hunted me since they rose to power, 200 years ago.

A: 200 years...by Talos, how old are you?

I: Way older than you can imagine, child. And I know what the Thalmor are truly capable of. Their presence in Skyrim is harmless.

A: They are a constant thread to all true sons and daughters of Skyrim! How...

I: Believe me. I know how they treat those who oppose them on the Isles. They are monsters.

A: I...

I: And we better not tell your mother about Northwatch Keep. She'll only worry more.

A: Yes. You're right.

I: I swear by Trinimac that I will bring Thorald back home safely. If he is still ... you know.

A: May Talos procet him. And you.
