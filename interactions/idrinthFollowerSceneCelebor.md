## Scene 1

I: Are you an actual Paladin? I've last seen one in my childhood. Blessed by the Ancestors and protecting everyone around them.

C: Yes, don't worry I can sense Trinimac's blessing on you, cursed one.

I: Could you teach me after we end your brother's suffering for you? I would like to learn more. I'm a mere apprentice compared to you.

C: First cleanse the chapel of my brother please.

I: Consider it done, neither my friend nor I tend to disappoint.

## Scene 2

I: You know my request, Knight-Paladin. Would you grant it?

C: Yes, it will be granted.

I: May the ancestors bless you for this. Friend, I will stay for a while to learn and return to you afterwards. My heart really longs to learn more.
