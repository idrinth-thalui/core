## Scene 1

S: So you're the vampire Kodlak mentioned.

I: So it seems. Skjor, I presume?

S: Yes. I'm watching you, Elf. This is a place for warriors.

I: I sense quite some hostility in your voice.

S: I fought in the Great War. Nearly lost my life outside the Imperial City. I was lucky.

I: I understand. By Trinimac, I assure you that the Thalmor are my enemies as well as yours.

S: You will still need to prove that, Elf. I'll take my leave.
