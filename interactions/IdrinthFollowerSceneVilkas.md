## Scene 1

I: Vilkas, do you have a moment?

V: I suppose you have another question?

I: Yes. Farkas mentioned you know a lot about Jorrvaskr's history?

V: I know our history almost as well as Vignar. What do you want?

I: Do you know the origin of the Skyforge? I heard ancient legends saying it was made by Trinimac -or Auri-El, blocking an ancient evil.

V: The original Companions came here. They saw the Skyforge. They saw the elves don't like it, so they stayed. Strange. Never thought of it why.

I: I always thought it was a golden eagle, not a hawk.

V: Who knows what dead god forged it?
