## Scene 1 (History lesson)

I: Vilkas, do you have a moment?

V: I suppose you have another question?

I: Yes. Farkas mentioned you know a lot about Jorrvaskr's history?

V: I know our history almost as well as Vignar. What do you want?

I: Do you know the origin of the Skyforge? I heard ancient legends saying it was made by Trinimac -or Auri-El, blocking an ancient evil.

V: The original Companions came here. They saw the Skyforge. They saw the elves don't like it, so they stayed. Strange. Never thought of it why.

I: I always thought it was a golden eagle, not a hawk.

V: Who knows what dead god forged it?


## Scene 2 (Money, money)

I: Vilkas, there's something I wanted to ask you.

V. You're a talkative one, eh? What is it?

I: I noticed you are quite eager for coin. Yet you claim to be an honourable warrior, following... Ysgramor's traditions.

V: Wherever someone in Skyrim doesn't feel up to defending their own honor, we'll take up their burden. They pay well.

I: And where lies your honour in this?

V: There are always good reasons to fight. Look at the esteemed company before you. A bunch of happy pups. Lots of mead. No going into a fight on an empty stomach.
   Gold saves most problems.
   
I: I see. Being Master at Arms holds more responsibility than I thought.

V: Yes. So try to show some respect.
