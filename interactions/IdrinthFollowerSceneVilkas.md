## Scene 1 (History lesson)

I: Vilkas, do you have a moment?

V: I suppose you have another question?

I: Yes. Farkas mentioned you know a lot about Jorrvaskr's history?

V: I know our history almost as well as Vignar. What do you want to know?

I: Do you know the origin of the Skyforge? I heard ancient legends saying it was made by Trinimac or Auri-El, blocking an ancient evil.

V: The original Companions came here. They saw the Skyforge. They saw the Elves don't like it, so they stayed. Strange. Never thought of why the Elves feared it.

I: I always thought it was a golden eagle, not a hawk.

V: Who knows what dead god forged it? All the Elves knew was that is was older than them settling in Skyrim.

## Scene 2 (Money, money)

I: Vilkas, there's something I wanted to ask you.

V. You're a talkative one, eh? What is it?

I: I noticed you are quite eager for coin. Yet you claim to be an honourable warrior, following...Ysgramor's traditions.

V: Wherever someone in Skyrim doesn't feel up to defending their own honour, we'll take up their burden. They pay well.

I: And where lies your honour in this?

V: There are always good reasons to fight. Look at the esteemed company before you. A bunch of happy pups. Lots of mead drunk. No going into a fight on an empty stomach. Wounds to tend. And the Civil War takes a toll on all of Skyrim's citizens. Gold solves most problems.

I: So you're saying...

V: Many children lost their parents. Many farms deserted. We Companions vowed to protect Skyrim and her people.

I: I see. Being Master at Arms holds more responsibility than I thought.

V: Yes. So try to show some respect.

I: Honour to you. (bows)
