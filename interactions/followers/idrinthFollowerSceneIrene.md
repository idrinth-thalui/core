## Greetings
IT: Good day to you, Breton. I am called Idrinth Thalui and happy to make your acquaintance. What may I call you?

IG: hiya, I am Irene Gray nice to meet ya and I'm only half Breton actually. I’m half Nord on me mam’s side

IT: Glad to meet you either way. What made you come on this adventure? For me it’s the thrill in seeing him/her(the dragonborn) grow.

IG: Well I needed help with taking my mam’s ashes to a Skaal village in solstheim 

IT: That is a noble goal. You can count on my assistance!

## Enchanting I

IT: It has always been a pastime to me, but you seem to enjoy enchanting. Is there a specific reason you chose to specialise in it?

IG: Well I love fire and ice. Those are my favourite legal enchantments to work with.

IT: I don’t like fire much, I prefer lightning to either of those. Ice is a very useful tool as well though.

IG: Okay fine my favourite illegal enchantment is levitation that or body modifying ones like the ring I am wearing.

IT: Those are both valuable skills to know. I doubt levitation will be banned forever, it is way too useful to stay forbidden. I’m not so sure about the second one though, a lot of people are very cautious about anything that could affect their looks.

## Bretons in Skyrim

IT: How are you treated by the Nords? Most of the time they seem to treat other races of men well enough. Dabbling in magic is disliked though…

IG: Oh they dislike me when I use actual magic. They tend to hate me for being a bairn of  reachmen.

IT: Nothing I would judge you for. It can be hard to travel amongst people fearing or hating you, I know all too well…

IG: Thanks, that means alot to me. 

## Advise

IT: I wonder, would you mind having a look at my gear’s enchantments? Maybe there is something you notice that I did not do, something to improve maybe…

IG: Well, let's have a look. It seems to be eating up charge very fast. How long have you had it?

IT: A few hundred years at most, fixing gear at some point doesn’t make much sense anymore.

IG: Aye, it does need mending. I can have a look at it once we get to an enchanting table.

IT: I appreciate that! Maybe I lost track of years and it’s older already…

## Men-Mer

IT: You know, for a distant cousin you have quite a phenomenal skill in magic. A strong mer-side should also give you a longer life. I hope it will be enjoyable, like the adventure we are on here.

IG: Aye, magic is fun just the whole vibrations and variations of it. I know Bretons are like half elves? And I do relate to the me mer kinsmen more than I do the average Nord but that's because I am told my ears are pointy

IG: Some of the Nords here really know how to make me feel like an outsider.

IT: If you have enough power, everyone will want you either dead or as a “friend”, short sighted of them, but that has always been the case.

IG: Aye “friends” 

IT: They can be useful, often they work as a shield against people that would harm you. Unintentionally of course and with a bit of help from your side.

## Enchanting II

IT: I wonder, have you mastered enchanting with multiple enchantments yet? I am proud of my blade with its dual enchantment, but I may try to spend more time on enchanting to make it more powerful in a few hundred years.

IG: lucky for some I guess that get to live that long but to answer your question I have managed it. 

IT: There are good and bad things to a long life. You lose friends and family again and again, but you learn a lot about the topics that interest you.

IG: Aye, the old black and white.. Kind of like soul gems 

IT: If there is one thing I learned through my life, it is that few things can not be grey. There is always a benefit for someone and a drawback for someone else.

## Vampirism I

IG: So not to be rude and i hate to hoy this at ya but are you a vampire?


IT: Yes, have been for ages. I don’t worship a daedric prince nor drink from the living though. You are safe, that I swear by Trinimac and my honour.

IT(Player is Vampire): And I will not tolerate anyone else drinking from you.

IG: Thank the All maker but I would not judge you badly if you did though if ya did. I’d prefer that you ask.

IT: I will not ask, there are enough foes I can drain to last me an eternity. I’ve learned from the green pact, that food sources are plenty if you know where to look for them.

IG: I take a similar approach to taking souls.

IT: That is greatly appreciated.
Dragons
IG: So.. Dragons, what do you make of them?

IT: I have seen them before as rulers of men, but never this destructive and aggravated.

IG: Right, I've only heard tales and what we have seen with our friend here.

IT: I always stayed away from them and their priests, so I’m not a great help here. I know they are both very territorial as well as very greedy. Maybe their current destruction is them trying to win the dragon war from ages past?

IG: Maybe? I know their souls can't be held by most gems and seem to need living vessels that have the blood of a dragon.

IT: There may still be a gem big enough for them that has not been discovered yet. It would not be the first spirit bound to a stone that I have heard of.

## Briarhearts

IT: I wonder if you ever got into contact with the Briarhearts. Fearsome warriors for sure in their undeath, unlive or whatever it is they have. I would be curious to know more about them and their place in their society.

Ig: No not really. I’ve spent most of my life in the seaside city of Northpoint though I think my dad knows some. 

Ig: from what i understand or how me dad tells it they are fearsome warriors who have given everything for the freedom of the reach. 

Ig: Though i kind of respect them from what ive heard it must take great devotion to their movement to go through with that. However it is borderline necromancy and I don't like that. 

IT: Thank you! I appreciate you sharing that. I have fought some of course, but so far none were willing to talk and share. I don’t like conjuration very much, even less necromancy, but it is more dangerous to not know…

## Aldmeri Dominion I

IG: So what do you think of the dominion?

IT: I am worried about their real intentions. The current Thalmor never play with an open hand and the conquering of Tamriel is too obvious to be their main intention. As you may have noticed, they don’t like me meddling in their affairs.

IT(Quest 1 done): Especially the latest attack on them seems to have increased their hunting of me.

IG: okay that's good i guess i am safe around you then

IT: I wouldn’t go that far, but at least I don’t mean you any harm. Given your heritage, I’m surprised the Thalmor are an issue for you at all.

IG: They killed my mam and I kind of worry that I'll end up with the same fate.

IT: They killed many, I am sorry about your mother being amongst them. If they still were like the Thalmor of old, this would not have happened.

## Believes

IT: Given your background and our previous exchanges, you believe in the All-Maker, like Skaals do? Do you consider other spirits as well?

IG: Aye i believe in the all maker and his spirits but also i have faith in other gods like Hircine the Beastfather and Namira the Spirit Queen.

IG: but i feel closest to the spirit of the storm Kyne and i have a soft spot for mara the spirit of the wolf 

IG: Sorry I am rambling, what about yourself?

IT: Among the ancestors, I mostly serve Trinimac, the Paragon. His dedication to protecting the mer is something I am trying to recreate. Protecting others is a noble goal, for any warrior.

IT(favour > 700): There was a time I was bound to worship Molag Bal as a father figure. I am glad I left that behind many long years ago.

IT: I can fully understand venerating Kyne and Hircine, they are both powerful beings with goals that can be understood.

(if player has not done molag bals quest) IG: I understand that me dad use to say he was one of the struggle gods there to test us. 
(if player has done molag bals quest) IG: I… hate the dread father.. He made me and our friend here do awful things. I don't want to talk about it.

IT: This prince is a tool used by other princes more than a creature with its own plans I believe. But yes, the way he executes plans is horrible.

## Aldmeri Dominion II  

IG: Aldmeri Dominion seem very anti human. Like i understand they are elven government but that does not make much sense at least not from what i heard in high rock

IT:  It is true that the Thalmor hate men. They see them as lesser and enemies to mer. It is not the same with all members of the dominion. The public opinion is just very well controlled and anyone not fitting in is made to disappear.

IG: So I am guessing they don't like us bretons being the half man half elf thing. Are there many bretons in the dominion?

IT: I don’t know of any large number of Bretons in the Dominion, but of course there are some turn coats, some spies and some, who want to secure power. What they usually don’t realise is that the Thalmor even view other mer as lesser and the Altmer as the only ones with sufficient purity.

IG: I would be like 3 cheers for high rock. But we have a similar problem where the leadership seem to view humans over elves even if those elves are Manmeri or half elves.

IT: It is natural for people to prefer their own or more similar over less similar. Every culture has it, every race and every nation. The price cultures pay for that is usually tiny, but it affects us individuals a lot. With Man-Mer being one of the groups with the least similarity to both humans and elves. At least in their eyes.

IG: Okay well i guess i am not going to the summerset isle for summer then.

## Sheor(Shor)
 
IT:  What is your viewpoint of Sheor? I know that Bretons see Sheor in a different light.

IG: Depends how i am feeling. If I’ve bumped me toes I'll curse Sheor. If I'm shocked, I'll go by Shor!

IG: I know that my countrymen view him as the badman but personally I seen him as a man of mischief.

IT: He may be both, from what I know of him he tricked the ancestors into giving up their power. But then again, his heart is the heart of the world, so it may not have been all bad.

## Thu’um

IT: I wonder, do you have any interest in learning to shout? It’s a kind of magic as well after all. An old kind, gifted from Kyne to her people.

IG: Aye, to learn to carry her wind was some that my mam wanted me to learn. Sadly I was more interested in soul gems than the old voice.

IG: But if I was given the chance, Idrinth, I would like to learn it even if it's just a little.

IT: I have never had the chance so far, but following the dragonborn may be beneficial. I hope to learn a bit from him/her. A tool this powerful must be retained, not forgotten and hidden.

## Vampirism II

IT: I am curious, you haven’t yet asked me to turn you. Is that because of your disgust of Molag Bal? It’s unusual, most men that knew wanted to be turned.

IG: I don't know if i could manage it honestly and like would necromancers see me as a corpse to use in their craft.

 (only if player has done the molag quest) Ig: And the Molag Bal stuff does make me unwell when I think about it.

IT: I have seen a few fools try their luck, but no, they don’t command the intelligent undead. Their craft is usually limited to lesser undead, like for example skeletons.

IT(if molag bal quest done): I get that, him hanging like an executioner’s axe over my soul is not something I enjoy either.

IT: I am glad you don’t jump at the opportunity of gaining almost immortality. Shows that you are stronger than some.

IG: I am not strong but thank you. It is nice for you to say that. 

## Necromancy

IG: So Idrinth what do you think about necromancy?
IT: Dangerous and unnatural. Anything conjured weakens Nirn by introducing something that should not be. With necromancy that is unlife, a mockery of what Tamriel has to offer at best. Enslaving others’ souls is not something that should be done.
IG:I know that's why I try not to summon stuff unless it's really needed.
IG: Also enslaving the dead is awful and makes me no better than a baron over a serf.
IT: I think a barron is still a better case, the serf does keep their own will. I appreciate you not using conjuration as if it had no price!
IG: I can hoy spells of fire and ice, that's all the magic i need for combat.

## High rock

IG: Have you been to high rock?

IT: I’ve been all over Tamriel, High Rock has been a while though. I assume it changed a lot in the last hundred or so years. Can’t say I like its politics, but the province is a kinder place to travel for me than Cyrodiil or Skyrim are.

IG: I see, it is nice. I love the craigs and glens. I kind of miss them.

IT: I am more interested in the people and their crafts. But yes, the nature there is also beautiful. Maybe we should travel towards Markarth a bit more often, it is relatively similar at least.

IG: Yea it is. That's one of the reasons I stopped there for a bit.

## Past loves

IG: Do you have any loves? You seem like the loner type but I could be wrong.

IT: Being a loner is something that comes with age. I have been married for many decades and I am in contact with other living members of my extended family. I keep the contact short though, to not raise the Thalmor’s interest in them further. Having them interested is never a good thing to happen to people.

IG: I can agree to that last part! 

IG: I have loves but I am not on good terms with my dad sadly.

IT: I am sorry to hear that. My father nearly killed my then not yet wife a few times, when we met in secret in the gardens. I don’t think he ever forgave me for marrying her.

IG: Mine just said that he did not like that i wanted to respect my ma’s wishes as well as other things.

## Soul gems

IG: Have you got any soul gems Idrinth?

IT: Usually a few, yes. I tend to sell them to court mages when I meet them, after all I have little need for most of them.

IG: Can I have one… I need one.

IT: Sure, let’s say three hundred septims for a filled grand soul gem? Let me just get it out of my travel gear…

IG: I'll settle for some fragments… they are not as hard to chew.

IT: Those I’ll give you for free, but why chew on them?

IG: Two reasons: One, it feeds the soul gem i ate when i was a bairn and reason number two i kind of enjoy it and makes me less hungry.

IT: A soul gem inside you? That is curious…I hope you don’t go to oblivion because of self-trapping your soul or something similar.

IG: I think it was a greater white soul gem so I should be fine but we’ll never know till that day.

IT: I know liches have some item that contains their lifeforce, maybe it works like that in a way? I’ll try to do some research in a quiet moment.

IG: If ya could that would be nice.
