# Anywhere in the college

I: May I bother you for a minute?
C: What do you want? Make jokes about me because I'm not a destruction mage?
I: I actually wanted to compare notes about restoration. I've been told you are quite skilled at it. I've been studiing for quite a while and still like to get better at saving lives!
C: Oh...Oh...I see. So you are a restoration mage yourself?
I: Among other schools, yes. It is one of the most useful schools I practise.
C: Oh, let me find my notes! I'll be right there!
I: Take your time, no need to hurry!
C: No, No, I can't keep you waiting! Where are my notes again? Did someone steal them again?
I: Steal from the one who could save your life? That is insane.
C: Sadly it happens quite often. They don't see Restoration as a valid school...
I: It is one of the most important schools. Let's stay in contact via courier, I'll send you a copy of my notes as soon as I can.
C: Thank you. It's good to hear that!

# With Ancano later

A: I heard you talked with the Vampire. What did he want?
C: Vampire? I don't think so...
A: Looks like a tall Altmer, goes by the name Idrinth. How can you fail to recognise one so obvious?
C: He's a vampire? He just wanted to talk about Restoration magic...
A: Why would he talk about that with you? You are far below his skill level? He must have wanted something else...
C: I...I don't know.
I: I see you are presenting your polite and friendly side again, Ancano!
A: What did you want with this...third grade student of Restoration, Vampire?
C: Third grade stu...
A: Before she was even born I had saved thousands of lives with restoration. A creature like you can't learn anything from her.
I: She is good, just not very experienced yet. We can always get better by learning from and teaching each other, Thalmor.
C: Are you really a Vampire? A murderer and creature of the night?
A: He is. A drainer of thousands, tormenter of mer and men.
I: I am cursed, yes. But I'm not harming anyone who doesn't try to kill me. Unlike a very living Thalmor. I serve...
C: Leave me alone, filthy Vampire. Go away, Daedra worshipper!
A: Ah, even the limited mind of a human understands that part. Be gone.
I: Trinimac curse you, Ancano.

# After Saarthal

I: I hope I'm not intruding?
C: Stay...away!
I: I'm sorry I wasn't entirely forthcoming with my condition. I assume you understand why?
C: Wha...What do you want?
I: I merely wanted to give you a copy of some of my notes. I am looking forward to see yours.
C: ...
I: I hope we can be better healers learning from each other.
C: I'll have a look. But if you do one wrong move...
I: Take your time, I hope these notes help save lives.

# As Archmage

I: I sadly haven't recieved any of your notes yet. I hopy mine were worthwhile for you?
C: Yes...
I: I hope you are not scared of me anymore, after all your archmage trusts me...
C: I have...have to accept his/her wisdom. Yes, your notes were useful to me. I will send mine once I can find them...
I: Do you need help searching for them?
C: N...No, thank you.
I: May Trinimac keep you save!
