## Dimhollow

I: How are you after your rest? It would drive me insane to be locked up for hundreds of years.

S: How would you know?

I: I've spent a few hundred years locked in service to my blood-mother. In hindsight it feels like I was locked up as well.

S: I agreed to this. It was important to my mother!

I: But not important to you, you served another when you should have spread your wings.

S: I'm free, my own free...

I: ...child?

## Castle Volkihar

I: If you ever need someone to talk to, I can offer myself. I've seen a lot in my years, I may be able to understand.

S: I...I don't know what you are talking about!

I: Then let me be more clear. I witnessed a possible Daughter of Coldharbour's sacrifice a long time ago. I'm not proud to have let it happen, it still haunts my nights. Also I've seen Nords rule in your parent's time. I may understand a bit of what happened to you.

S: I...will think about it.
