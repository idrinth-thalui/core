## Scene 1 (Warrior)

I: Farkas, can I talk to you?

F: My brother has the smarts, not me. He's a better talker. He's around here somewhere.

I: But I wanted to ask you something. If I may?

F: I see. What is it?

I: About the others mocking you...

F: Be careful what you say, Elf. They just tease me. People I don't like get my fists.

I: That's not what I meant. You should not fret about them. You're an excellent warrior. Heard about you and your brother rescuing those Dunmer refugees a few years ago. Frost trolls can be nasty, especially in large groups.

F: Ah, now that was a fight! Vilkas and I feasted for three days afterwards, singing songs and drinking mead...

I: Not all Nords would have gone out to save Elves. Thank you. And your brother.

F: They needed help. We fight for those who need help. You know, I like you. Let's drink some mead.

## Scene 2 ( Elves)

I: Farkas, do you mind?

F: What?

I: Another question? From one warrior to another?

F: Do what you must.

I: Since you're so eager to uphold the original Companion's legacy, how do you feel fighting alongside Elves?

F: The Elves burned Saarthal. Ysgramor killed them. But not all of them. Some were alright, I guess. Athis now is my shield-brother. We fight side by side. Simple.

I: And other Elves? Those not with the Companions? Like me? (And our friend here?)

F: You didn't burn Saarthal. And you're a warrior. Guess you're alright. (Both of you.)

I: But most Snow Elves did not want a war. They were good people. I do not run around killing Nords because some drunken lout in Windhelm attacks me.

F: Ysgramor grieved. Mind clouded with rage. You know, when the blood runs hot. If someone hurts my brother, I...

I: I understand. More than you might know.

F: I see. Thoughts of the hunt in your mind, too.

I: The dead we cannot make alive again. But maybe one day Mer and Men could live together in peace?

F: It shall be so.

## Scene 3 (Control)

I: So, I guess our mutual friend knows about your little secret, too. I must say, I find your level of self control over your lycanthropic nature commendable.

F: Huh?

I: You're good at staying calm. And not change in every battle. I know how hard it is, when the smell of blood...

F: Yeah. Blood runs hot. The beast wants to hunt. A warrior should feel alive and aware.

I: I guess you changed on purpose in Dustman's Cairn?

F: Um...you like skeever liver?

I: I take that as a yes, Farkas...
