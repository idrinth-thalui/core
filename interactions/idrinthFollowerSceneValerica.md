## Soul Cairn

V: I see my daughter brought even more mixed blood vampires here.

I: I may be of mixed blood, but my blood is about as powerful as yours, willing Bride of Molag Bal.

V: That was long ago.

I: You still subjected your own daughter to this treatment. I have seen it happen, it's a wonder she survived as undamaged as she did. How can you call yourself her mother?

V: You are talking to a queen. Behave properly, dirt blood!

I: You know, that you are no queen of mine. No royalty to me.

V: If you weren't keeping my daughter safe, I would end you for that...

I: Many have tried, no one has managed so far. Set yourself a realistic goal!
