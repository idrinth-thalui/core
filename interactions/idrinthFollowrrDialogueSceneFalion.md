## Falion's House

I: Can't say I want this company...

F: I recognise you from some old paintings and I know your kind.

I: You are familiar with Altmer? And you have seen family members of mine?

F: I was referring to your condition, not your race. I'll ask a few questions, all right?

I: I don't think I own you a reply, Conjurer. You dabble in a way too dangerous field.

F: Just a few questions, nothing too personal. Please?

I: Maybe in a few years if my doubts about you should vanish.
