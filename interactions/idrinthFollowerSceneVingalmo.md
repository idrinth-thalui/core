## Castle Volkihar

V: Ah, another new blood coming to the court. Let me introduce myself, I'm Lord Harkon's primary adviser Vingalmo.

I: Oh, you share a name with the Author of Treatise on the Altmer Antecedent.

V: Yes, I am that author. I've been alive for a long time, you would do well in pledging your weapon to Lord Harkon through me.

I: I always wanted to know how the author of that book came to make so many mistakes in describing Saarthal. You have never been there, have you?

V: You are brave to insult me like that. Are you sure you can win this little game?

I: I've been in courts like this before. Backstabbing without being seen is no art I am unfamiliar with, even if I obviously never participated myself. I would not sink that low...

V: I wouldn't backstab you, you are a guest of the court, not an enemy.

I: I also wouldn't want to dishonour anyone. My weapons will remain sheathed while I'm under your and Lord Harmon's protection. Although killing me with kindness could take a while...

V: I am just warning you, that others may not be as polite and civilized as I am.

I: Oh, brother, I don't have to worry about such accidents under your watchful eyes, do I? After all as Lord Harkon's primary adviser, no one would dare move against you...
