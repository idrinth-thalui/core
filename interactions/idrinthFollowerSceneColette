# Anywhere in the college

I: May I bother you for a minute?
C: What do you want? Make jokes about me because I'm not a destruction mage?
I: I actually wanted to compare notes about restoration. I've been told you are quite skilled at it. I've been studiing for quite a while and still like to get better at saving lives!
C: Oh...Oh...I see. So you are a restoration mage yourself?
I: Among other schools, yes. It is one of the most useful schools I practise.
C: Oh, let me find my notes! I'll be right there!
I: Take your time, no need to hurry!
C: No, No, I can't keep sou waiting! Where are my notes again? Did someone steal them again?
I: Steal from the one who could save your life? That is insane.
C: Sadly it happens quite often. They don't see Restoration as a valid school...
I: It is one of the most important schools. Let's stay in contact via courier, I'll send you a copy of my notes as soon as I can.
C: Thank you. It's good to hear that!
