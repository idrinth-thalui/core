# Overview

Idrinth is an old vampire, who has at the very least witnessed the oblivion crisis personally. Besides a dislike for daedra, his main enemies are the Thalmor, who are in his opinion a destructive force that has to be stopped before their damage to Tamriel is irreversible.

He grew up on the Summerset Isles, with a family of 5. While his siblings ended up in usual positions of power, he was driven to wandering off, trying to explore the world.

When he first left the Isles, he was turned into a vampire by a daughter of coldharbour, who liked to collect elves as servants.

Taking quite a few years to return to his usual self from being a dutiful servant to a dark master, who followed her every whim, he again gained his freedom by fleeing, returning to a life of wandering Tamriel.

During the Great War he fought against the Aldmeri dominion mostly within Cyrodil, ambushing supplies where possible, since he considered joining the empire’s army too big of a risk for an Altmer Vampire.

After many years his travels took him to Skyrim, where he desires to end the bloody civil war quickly, weaken the Thalmor and learn about the Thu’um.
