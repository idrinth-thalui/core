## Scene 1

I: So you are the current Harbinger?

K: Yes, lad. I wanted to have a look at you. So, you are with our newest whelp?

I: Yes, I travel with him (her). Afraid I might hurt your newest applicant?

K: Some prefer living as beasts. Others seek honour and glory. What is it you seek?

I: I follow Trinimac, the Paragon of Auri-El. I seek to redeem myself. The things I have done in the past still haunt me. But I presume you know very well what I mean?

K: Your question carries more weight than you know. Yes, lad, but it's no easy matter. Some may prefer to live as beasts, others crave the fellowship of their shield-siblings. Does the smell of blood excite you?

I: I can control myself. I'm not a beast anymore than you are.

K: Be careful not to take more lives than honour demands. Talos guide you.
