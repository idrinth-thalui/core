## Scene 1 (Warrior)

I: Farkas, can I talk to you?

F: My brother has the smarts, not me. He's a better talker. He's around here somewhere.

I: But I wanted to ask you something. If I may?

F: I see. What is it?

I: About the others mocking you...

F: Be careful what you say, Elf. They just tease me. People I don't like get my fists.

I: That's not what I meant. You should not fret about them. You're an excellent warrior. Heard about you and your brother rescuing those Dunmer refugees a few years ago.
   Frost trolls can be nasty, especially in large groups.
   
F: Ah, now that was a fight! Vilkas and I feasted for three days afterwards, singing songs and drinking mead...

I: Not all Nords would have gone out to save Elves. Thank you. And your brother.

F: They needed help. We fight for those who need help. You know, I like you. Let's drink some mead.
