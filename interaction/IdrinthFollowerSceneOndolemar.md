## Scene 1:

O: You! What leads you to Markarth? Make it quick, but mind your tongue.

I: As charming as ever, Ondolemar. What's a superior bred mer like you doing here?

O: It's a necessary part of my job. I lead the Justiciars to root out the Talos heresy, and I'm here to make sure the Jarl of Markarth remembers that.

I: I heard about your promotion after you manage to return most of your unit from Naarifin's failed attempt of sacrificing the Imperial City to the Thrice-Cursed.
   I do presume congratulations are in order? Oh wait, I heard your son and grandson didn't make it...Naarifin got them.

O: How dare you to speak of them in such a disgusting manner! I'd kill you where you stand if I wasn't bound by my oath as an officer of the Aldmeri Dominion!

I: I merely try to offer my condolences,  I always forget that you have a heart, even if it's frozen in ice.

O: Hmph, fine. I am done with you. You will leave immediately or I'll burn the flesh from your bones.

I: Charming as always, jorane ba alis.

O: What was that?!

I: Nothing. I'm leaving.
